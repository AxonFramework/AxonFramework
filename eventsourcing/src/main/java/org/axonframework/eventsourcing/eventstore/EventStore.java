/**
 * Infrastructure component providing the means to start an {@link EventStoreTransaction} to
 * {@link EventStoreTransaction#appendEvent(EventMessage) append events} and
 * {@link EventStoreTransaction#source(SourcingCondition) event source} models from the underlying storage solution.
 * <p>
 * As an extension of the {@link EventBus}, this {@code EventStore} serves as both the event storage mechanism and
 * the event distribution mechanism. This dual role allows the EventStore to persist events durably while simultaneously
 * distributing them to subscribed event handlers, eliminating the need for a separate {@link EventBus} component in
 * event sourcing scenarios. Through the {@link SubscribableEventSource} capability inherited
 * from EventBus, components can {@link SubscribableEventSource#subscribe(java.util.function.BiFunction) subscribe}
 * to receive events as they are stored. The exact timing of when events are published to subscribers is
 * implementation-dependent and may occur within the same transaction if the {@link ProcessingContext} is shared between
 * the storage and distribution operations.
 * <p>
 * As an implementation of the {@link EventSink}, this {@code EventStore} will initiate a
 * {@link #transaction(ProcessingContext)} when {@link #publish(ProcessingContext, List)} is triggered to append events.
 * When a {@code null ProcessingContext} is given on {@link #publish(ProcessingContext, List)}, the implementation
 * should decide to construct a context itself or fail outright.
 * <p>
 * As an implementation of the {@link StreamableEventSource}, this {@code EventStore} will allow for {@link #open} a
 * stream of events and use it as a source for
 * {@link StreamingEventProcessor}.

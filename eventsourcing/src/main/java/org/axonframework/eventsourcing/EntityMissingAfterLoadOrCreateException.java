 * {@link EventSourcingRepository#load(Object, ProcessingContext)} should be used instead, which will leave the entity
 * as {@code null} if no events are found.
 * <p>
 * If the entity has a constructor that takes no arguments or an identifier, the factory should be adjusted to return a
 * non-null entity when no event message is present.

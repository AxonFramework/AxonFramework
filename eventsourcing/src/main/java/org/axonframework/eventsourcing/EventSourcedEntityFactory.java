/**
 * Defines how an {@link EventSourcingRepository} should construct an entity of type {@code E}.
 * <p>
 * When sourcing an entity, the state is initially {@code null}. The first event will initialize the entity through
 * {@link #create(Object, EventMessage, ProcessingContext)}.
 * <p>
 * If no events are found during sourcing, the repository will return {@code null} for the entity if
 * {@link EventSourcingRepository#load(Object, ProcessingContext)} was used. However, if
 * {@link EventSourcingRepository#loadOrCreate(Object, ProcessingContext)} was used, the repository will return an empty
 * entity through calling {@link #create(Object, EventMessage, ProcessingContext)} with a {@code null} {@code firstEventMessage}. This may
 * return null in case the entity should be created with the first event message only, for example when it is
 * immutable.
 * <p>
 * Depending on the type of entity, the factory should be created differently. The following types of entities are
 * supported:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>
 *         Mutable entities: these entities are created with a no-argument constructor. All command handlers of the
 *         entity should be {@link EntityModelBuilder#instanceCommandHandler(QualifiedName, EntityCommandHandler) instance
 *         command handlers}. Use {@link #fromNoArgument(Supplier)} to create a factory for this type of entity.
 *     </li>
 *     <li>
 *         Mutable entities with non-null identifier: these entities are created with a constructor that takes the
 *         identifier as parameter. All command handlers of the entity should be
 *         {@link EntityModelBuilder#instanceCommandHandler(QualifiedName, EntityCommandHandler) instance command handlers}.
 *         Use {@link #fromIdentifier(Function)} to create a factory for this type of entity.
 *     </li>
 *     <li>
 *         Immutable entities, or entities with non-nullable parameters: these entities are created with a constructor that takes
 *         the identifier and the event message as parameters. The entity should have a combination of
 *         {@link EntityModelBuilder#creationalCommandHandler(QualifiedName, CommandHandler) creational command handlers} to
 *         create the entity if no events exist for it, and
 *         {@link EntityModelBuilder#instanceCommandHandler(QualifiedName, EntityCommandHandler) instance command handlers} to
 *         handle commands when it does exist. If a command could potentially handle both cases, it would need to be
 *         registered as both a creational and instance command handler.
 *         Use {@link #fromEventMessage(BiFunction)} to create a factory for this type of entity.
 *      </li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Implementations should be thread-safe.
 *
 * @param <ID> The type of the identifier of the entity to create.
 * @param <E>  The type of the entity to create.

     * Creates an entity of type {@code E} with the given identifier. The identifier is guaranteed to be non-null. The
     * supplied {@code firstEventMessage} is the first event message that is present in the stream of the entity. If no
     * event messages are present, this method will be called with a {@code null} {@code firstEventMessage} to get an
     * initial state when calling {@link EventSourcingRepository#loadOrCreate(Object, ProcessingContext)}. Using
     * {@link EventSourcingRepository#load(Object, ProcessingContext)} would never call this method with a {@code null}
     * {@code firstEventMessage}.
     * <p>
     * Invocations with a non-null {@code firstEventMessage} must always return a non-null entity, while invocations
     * with a null {@code firstEventMessage} may return null.
     * <p>
     * Whether to return {@code null} from a {@code null} {@code firstEventMessage} invocation depends on the type
     * of command handler which should be invoked when the entity does not exist. If this is a
     * {@link EntityModelBuilder#creationalCommandHandler(QualifiedName, CommandHandler) creational command handler},
     * this should return {@code null}. If this is a
     * {@link EntityModelBuilder#instanceCommandHandler(QualifiedName, EntityCommandHandler) instance command handler},

     * entity, or a constructor that takes the identifier as parameter.
     * <p>

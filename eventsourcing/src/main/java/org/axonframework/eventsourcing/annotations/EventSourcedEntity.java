/**
 * Annotation to configure several aspects of an event-sourced entity. This annotation is required to construct an
 * annotation-based entity through the {@link EventSourcedEntityModule#annotated(Class, Class)}.
 *
 * <h2>Event Criteria</h2>
 * While loading the entity from the {@link EventSourcingRepository}, the provided {@code id} needs to be translated to
 * an {@link EventCriteria} instance to load the correct events. Unless overridden, this translation is done by the
 * {@link AnnotationBasedEventCriteriaResolver}. The {@link EventCriteria} will be resolved in the following order:
 * <ol>
 *     <li>
 *         Using the custom {@link #criteriaResolverDefinition()}. The definition should return a {@link CriteriaResolver},
 *         implement the {@link CriteriaResolverDefinition} interface, and have a no-arg constructor.
 *     </li>
 *     <li>
 *         By defining a static method in the entity class annotated with {@link EventCriteriaBuilder} which returns an
 *         {@link EventCriteria} and accepts the {@code id} as a parameter. This method should be static and return an
 *         {@link EventCriteria}. Multiple methods can be defined with different id types, and the first matching method
 *         will be used. Optionally, you can define {@link org.axonframework.messaging.MessageTypeResolver} as a second
 *         parameter to resolve the type of the message. Other arguments are not supported.
 *     </li>
 *     <li>
 *         If no matching {@link EventCriteriaBuilder} is found, the {@link EventSourcedEntity#tagKey()} will be used as
 *         the tag key, and the {@link Object#toString()} of the id will be used as value.
 *     </li>
 *     <li>
 *         If the {@link EventSourcedEntity#tagKey()} is empty, the {@link Class#getSimpleName()} of the entity will be
 *         used as the key, and the {@link Object#toString()} of the id will be used as value.
 *     </li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <h2>Entity Factory</h2>
 * Event-sourced entities need to be instantiated before they can be evolved based on past events. The
 * {@link EventSourcedEntityFactory} is responsible for creating a new instance of the entity.
 * By default, this is done based on constructors or static methods annotated with {@link EntityCreator}.
 * These creators can take the payload or message of the first event, or the entity id as a parameter.
 * For more information, see the examples in the Javadoc of the annotation.
 *
 * <h2>Command handling</h2>
 * Entities can declare {@link org.axonframework.commandhandling.annotations.CommandHandler}-annotated methods
 * to execute a command on the entity. When a command targets an entity, the following steps are taken:
 * <ol>
 *     <li>The {@link org.axonframework.modelling.entity.EntityCommandHandlingComponent} will use the
 *     {@link EntityIdResolverDefinition} to resolve the entity id from the command message.</li>
 *     <li>The entity id is used to resolve the {@link EventCriteria} for the entity, as described above.</li>
 *     <li>The {@link EventSourcedEntityFactory} is used to create a new instance of the entity by the {@link EventSourcingRepository}.</li>
 *     <li>Existing events for the entity are used to {@link org.axonframework.modelling.EntityEvolver evolve} the entity.</li>
 *     <li>The command is called on the entity in case of a
 *     {@link org.axonframework.modelling.entity.EntityMetamodelBuilder#instanceCommandHandler(QualifiedName, EntityCommandHandler) instance command handler},
 *     or on the {@link org.axonframework.modelling.entity.EntityMetamodelBuilder#creationalCommandHandler(QualifiedName, CommandHandler) creational command handler}
 *     if it did not exist.
 *     </li>
 * </ol>
 * <p>
 * By default, the id is resolved using the {@link AnnotationBasedEntityIdResolver}, which resolves the
 * id based on the {@link org.axonframework.modelling.annotation.TargetEntityId} annotation on a field or method
 * of the command payload. You can customize this behavior by providing a custom {@link #entityIdResolverDefinition()}.
 *
 * <h2>Polymorphic entities</h2>
 * Polymorphic entities are entities that can have multiple concrete types, and the type of the entity is determined
 * by the payload of the first event. In this case, the {@link EventSourcedEntity#concreteTypes()} should be
 * specified with the concrete types of the entity.

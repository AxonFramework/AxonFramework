/**
 * An expansion of the {@link EntityModule}, specifically for event-sourced entities. When constructed, either
 * {@link #autodetected(Class, Class) autodetected} or {@link #declarative(Class, Class) declarative}, it provides the
 * resulting {@link Repository} with the nearest {@link StateManager} so the state can be loaded.
 *
 * <h2>Command Handling</h2>
 * An {@link EntityCommandHandlingComponent} will be registered to the {@link CommandBus} that subscribes to the
 * commands of the {@link EntityMetamodel} that describes this entity. This is only done if an {@link EntityIdResolver}
 * is provided. If no {@link EntityIdResolver} is provided, no command handling component will be registered, but the
 * entity will still be registered to the {@link StateManager} so it can be loaded in stateful command handlers.
 *
 * <h2>Annotation-based entities</h2>
 * Entities annotated with {@link EventSourcedEntity} can be built using {@link #autodetected(Class, Class)}. This will
 * automatically build all required components based on the {@link EventSourcedEntity} annotation present on the entity
 * type.
 *
 * <h2>Declarative building</h2>
 * Entities can also be built using the {@link #declarative(Class, Class)} method. This allows for a more manual
 * approach to building the event-sourced entity, where the user can provide the required components.
 * <p>
 * There are several phases of the building process of the declarative event-sourced entity module:
 *     <ul>
 *         <li> {@link MessagingModelPhase} - Provides the {@link EntityMetamodel} of the event-sourced entity being built.</li>
 *         <li> {@link EntityFactoryPhase} - Provides the {@link EventSourcedEntityFactory} for the event-sourced entity
 *         being built.</li>
 *         <li> {@link CriteriaResolverPhase} - Provides the {@link CriteriaResolver} for the event-sourced entity being
 *         built.</li>
 *         <li> {@link EntityIdResolverPhase} - Provides the {@link EntityIdResolver} for the event-sourced entity being
 *         built, or provides the user with a choice to not have a {@link EntityCommandHandlingComponent}.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Module hierarchy</h2>
 * This module does not provide a {@link StateManager} by itself, but rather registers the entity to the nearest
 * {@link StateManager} in the module hierarchy. This means that you can load the event-sourced entity from the
 * nearest parent configuration that provides a {@link StateManager}, or any of that parent's children modules.
 * As such, to ensure access, this module should be registered at the right place in the module hierarchy.
 *
 * @param <ID> The type of identifier used to identify the event-sourced entity.
 * @param <E>  The type of the event-sourced entity.

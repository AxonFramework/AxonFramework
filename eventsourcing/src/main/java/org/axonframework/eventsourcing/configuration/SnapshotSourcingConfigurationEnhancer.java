/**
 * A {@link ConfigurationEnhancer} making the {@link EventStorageEngine} support the
 * {@link SourcingStrategy.Snapshot snapshot sourcing strategy}, by decorating it with the configured
 * {@link SnapshotStore} through {@link SnapshotCapableEventStorageEngine#decorate(EventStorageEngine, SnapshotStore)}.
 * <p>
 * The engine is left as is when no {@code SnapshotStore} is configured, and when it is the configured
 * {@code SnapshotStore} itself. The latter resolves the snapshot within its own {@code source} call, in a single round
 * trip, which decorating would undo.
 * <p>
 * Registered by {@link EventSourcingConfigurationDefaults}, so applications registering those defaults manually receive
 * it as well. It is deliberately not contributed through the {@link java.util.ServiceLoader}, unlike its sibling
 * enhancers, to keep that single registration channel. Registered for the {@link RegistrationScope.Scope#CURRENT
 * current} registry only, since the defaults registering it are copied into every module registry and would otherwise
 * register it there a second time.
 * <p>
 * A storage topology composing snapshot sourcing itself disables this enhancer, taking over that responsibility:
 * <pre>{@code
 * configurer.componentRegistry(
 *         registry -> registry.disableEnhancer(SnapshotSourcingConfigurationEnhancer.class)
 * );
 * }</pre>
 * An engine routing {@code source} to one engine per shard, tenant, or region is the case this exists for: the shard is
 * only known once a message is inspected, so decorating the routing engine would resolve snapshots before then, and the
 * engines it routes to would never receive the snapshot sourcing strategy. Such a topology composes each of its engines
 * with that engine's own snapshot store instead, through the same
 * {@link SnapshotCapableEventStorageEngine#decorate(EventStorageEngine, SnapshotStore) decorate} operation.
 * <p>
 * Disabling this enhancer without composing snapshot sourcing elsewhere leaves snapshots being written while never
 * being read: sourcing then replays an entity's full event history.

        // SnapshotStore.class (config.getOptionalComponent(SnapshotStore.class), to build the
        // SnapshotCapableEventStorageEngine wrapper when the engine is NOT self-hosting) -- so EventStorageEngine
        // is not actually independent of SnapshotStore here, as DirectionalCapabilityBridge's contract requires of
        // its "primary" type. Adding a decorator that makes SnapshotStore.class reach back into EventStorageEngine
        // makes the two slots mutually, lazily dependent: A's resolution nests into B's, whose decorator nests back
        // into A's (still mid-resolution), forever -- confirmed by the recursive
        // SnapshotSourcingConfigurationEnhancer <-> DirectionalCapabilityBridge stack in
        // SnapshotSourcingConfigurationEnhancerTest once this was wired in. This is exactly the "resolve() memoizes
        // on first call, so a symmetric dependency can't be resolved lazily by decorators alone" wall
        // DirectionalCapabilityBridge's own javadoc predicted -- except here it turns out EventStorageEngine.class
        // was never a safe "primary" to begin with, since it already, legitimately, depends on SnapshotStore.class.
        // Closing this gap for real needs the registry itself to know the two identifiers share one instance (see
        // DirectionalCapabilityBridge's javadoc); it is not achievable by composing more decorators.

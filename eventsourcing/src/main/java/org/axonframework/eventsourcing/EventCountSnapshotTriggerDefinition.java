/**
 * Snapshotter trigger mechanism that counts the number of events to decide when to create a snapshot. A snapshot is
 * triggered when the number of events applied on an aggregate exceeds the given {@code threshold}.
 * <p>
 * This number can exceed in two distinct scenarios:
 * <ol>
 *     <li> When initializing / event sourcing the aggregate in question.</li>
 *     <li> When new events are being applied by the aggregate.</li>
 * </ol>
 * <p>
 * If the definable {@code threshold} is met in situation one, the snapshot will be triggered regardless of the outcome
 * of command handling. Thus also if command handling returns exceptionally. If the {@code threshold} is only reached
 * once the aggregate has been fully initialized, than the snapshot will only be triggered if handling resolves
 * successfully.

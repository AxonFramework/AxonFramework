/**
 * Defines a policy for determining when an event-sourced entity should be snapshotted.
 * <p>
 * A {@code SnapshotPolicy} encapsulates the logic that decides whether a snapshot
 * is required based on metrics collected during sourcing, such as the number of events
 * applied since the last snapshot or the total time taken to source the entity.
 * <p>
 * Policies are <strong>immutable and thread-safe</strong>, so a single instance
 * can be shared across multiple entities and asynchronous operations.
 * <p>
 * Policies can be composed using {@link #or(SnapshotPolicy)} to combine multiple conditions.
 *
 * <p>Typical usage:</p>
 * <pre>{@code
 * SnapshotPolicy policy = SnapshotPolicy.afterEvents(100)
 *                                       .or(SnapshotPolicy.whenSourcingTimeExceeds(Duration.ofMillis(50)));

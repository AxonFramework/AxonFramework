/**
 * Annotation to configure several aspects of an event-sourced entity. This annotation is required to construct a
 * {@link AnnotationBasedEventSourcingEntityRepository}.
 * <p>
 * While loading the entity from the {@link EventSourcingRepository}, the provided {@code id} needs to be translated to
 * an {@link EventCriteria} instance to load the correct events. Unless overridden, this translation is done by the
 * {@link AnnotationBasedEventCriteriaResolver}. So, {@link EventCriteria} will be resolved in the following order:
 * <ol>
 *     <li>
 *         Using the custom {@link #criteriaResolver()}. The provided class should implement the {@link CriteriaResolver},
 *         and have a no-arg constructor, or a 1-arg constructor with the {@link Class} of the entity as parameter.
 *     </li>
 *     <li>
 *         By defining a static method in the entity class annotated with {@link EventCriteriaBuilder} which returns an
 *         {@link EventCriteria} and accepts the {@code id} as a parameter. This method should be static and return an
 *         {@link EventCriteria}. Multiple methods can be defined with different id types, and the first matching method
 *         will be used.
 *     </li>
 *     <li>
 *         If no matching {@link EventCriteriaBuilder} is found, the {@link EventSourcedEntity#tagKey()} will be used as the tag key, and the {@link Object#toString()} of the id will be used as value.
 *     </li>
 *     <li>
 *         If the {@link EventSourcedEntity#tagKey()} is empty, the {@link Class#getSimpleName()} of the entity will be used as tag key, and the {@link Object#toString()} of the id will be used as value.
 *     </li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>
 * The {@link #entityCreator()} is used to create a new instance of the entity. The provided class should implement the
 * {@link EventSourcedEntityCreator} interface, and have a no-arg constructor, or a 1-arg constructor with the {@link Class} of the entity as parameter.
 * By default, the {@link ConstructorBasedEventSourcedEntityCreator} is used, which creates a new instance using the
 * no-arg constructor of the entity class, or a 1-arg constructor with the id as parameter.

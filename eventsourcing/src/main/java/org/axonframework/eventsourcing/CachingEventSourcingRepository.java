     * aggregate type to be stored. All aggregates in this repository must be {@code instanceOf} this aggregate type.
     * To instantiate this AggregateModel, either an {@link AggregateModel} can be provided directly or an
     * {@code aggregateType} of type {@link Class} can be used. The latter will internally resolve to an
     * AggregateModel. Thus, either the AggregateModel <b>or</b> the {@code aggregateType} should be provided. An
     * {@link org.axonframework.common.AxonConfigurationException} is thrown if this criteria is not met.
     * The same criteria holds for the {@link AggregateFactory}. Either the AggregateFactory can be set directly or it
     * will be instantiated internally based on the {@code aggregateType}. Hence, one of both is a hard requirement, and
     * will also result in an AxonConfigurationException if both are missing.
     * <p>
     * Additionally will assert that the {@link LockFactory}, {@link EventStore}, {@link SnapshotTriggerDefinition} and
     * {@link Cache} are not {@code null}, resulting in an AxonConfigurationException if for any of these this is the
     * case.

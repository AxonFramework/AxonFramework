 * Base interface for all events in the application. All classes that represent an event should implement this
 * interface.
 * <p/>
 * Consider implementing one of the abstract subclasses to categorize events into one of three categories: <ul>
 * <li>{@link org.axonframework.domain.DomainEvent}: Events that represent a state change of an aggregate. <li>{@link
 * org.axonframework.domain.ApplicationEvent}: Events that do not represent a state change of an aggregate, but do have
 * an important meaning to the application. <li>{@link SystemEvent}: Events that represent a state change or
 * notification of a subsystem. These events typically notify the application that part of it is not available. </ul>

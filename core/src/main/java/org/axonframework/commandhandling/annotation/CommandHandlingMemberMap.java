 * Marker annotation for fields that contain a {@link java.util.Map} of Entities capable of handling Commands on behalf

 * Handler discovery mechanisms that the entity should also be inspected for {@link
 * org.axonframework.commandhandling.annotation.CommandHandler} annotated methods.
 * <p/>
 * Note that CommandHandler detection is done using static typing. This means that only the declared type of the field
 * can be inspected. If a subclass of that type is assigned to the field, any handlers declared on that subclass will
 * be ignored.

/**
 * Asynchronous CommandBus implementation with very high performance characteristics. It divides the command handling
 * process in two steps, which can be executed in different threads. The CommandBus is backed by a {@link Disruptor},
 * which ensures that two steps are executed sequentially in these threads, while minimizing locking and inter-thread
 * communication.
 * <p>
 * The process is split into two separate steps, each of which is executed in a different thread:
 * <ol>
 * <li><em>Command Handler execution</em><br/>This process invokes the command handler with the incoming command. The
 * result and changes to the aggregate are recorded for the next step.</li>
 * <li><em>Event storage and publication</em><br/>This process stores all generated domain events and publishes them
 * (with any optional application events) to the event bus. Finally, an asynchronous task is scheduled to invoke the
 * command handler callback with the result of the command handling result.</li>
 * </ol>
 * <p>
 * <em>Exceptions and recovery</em>
 * <p>
 * This separation of process steps makes this implementation very efficient and highly performing. However, it does
 * not cope with exceptions very well. When an exception occurs, an Aggregate that has been loaded is potentially
 * corrupt. That means that an aggregate does not represent a state that can be reproduced by replaying its committed
 * events. Although this implementation will recover from this corrupt state, it may result in a number of commands
 * being rejected in the meantime. These command may be retried if the cause of the {@link
 * AggregateStateCorruptedException} does not indicate a non-transient error.
 * <p>
 * Commands that have been executed against a potentially corrupt Aggregate will result in a {@link
 * AggregateStateCorruptedException} exception. These commands are automatically rescheduled for processing by
 * default. Use {@link DisruptorConfiguration#setRescheduleCommandsOnCorruptState(boolean)} disable this feature. Note
 * that the order in which commands are executed is not fully guaranteed when this feature is enabled (default).
 * <p>
 * <em>Limitations of this implementation</em>
 * <p>
 * Although this implementation allows applications to achieve extreme performance (over 1M commands on commodity
 * hardware), it does have some limitations. It only allows a single aggregate to be invoked during command processing.
 * <p>
 * This implementation can only work with Event Sourced Aggregates.
 * <p>
 * <em>Infrastructure considerations</em>
 * <p>
 * This CommandBus implementation has special requirements for the Repositories being used during Command Processing.
 * Therefore, the Repository instance to use in the Command Handler must be created using {@link
 * #createRepository(org.axonframework.eventsourcing.AggregateFactory)}.
 * Using another repository will most likely result in undefined behavior.
 * <p>
 * The DisruptorCommandBus must have access to at least 3 threads, two of which are permanently used while the
 * DisruptorCommandBus is operational. At least one additional thread is required to invoke callbacks and initiate a
 * recovery process in the case of exceptions.
 * <p>
 * Consider providing an alternative {@link IdentifierFactory} implementation. The default
 * implementation used {@link java.util.UUID#randomUUID()} to generated identifier for Events. The poor performance of
 * this method severely impacts overall performance of the DisruptorCommandBus. A better performing alternative is, for
 * example, <a href="http://johannburkard.de/software/uuid/" target="_blank">{@code com.eaio.uuid.UUID}</a>

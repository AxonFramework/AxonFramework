/**
 * Method-level annotation indicating that the annotated method i an event handler method for the saga instance.
 * <p/>
 * Annotated methods must comply to a few simple rules: <ul> <li>The method must accept 1 parameter: a subtype of
 * {@link
 * org.axonframework.domain.EventMessage} <li>Return values are allowed, but are ignored<li>Exceptions are highly
 * discouraged,
 * and are likely to be caught and ignored by the dispatchers </ul>
 * <p/>
 * For each event, only a single annotated method will be invoked. This method is resolved in the following order <ol>
 * <li>First, the event handler methods of the actual class (at runtime) are searched <li>If a method is found with a
 * parameter that the domain event can be assigned to, it is marked as eligible <li>After a class  has been evaluated
 * (but before any super class), the most specific event handler method is called. That means that if an event handler
 * for a class A and one for a class B are eligible, and B is a subclass of A, then the method with a parameter of type
 * B will be chosen<li>If no method is found in the actual class, its super class is evaluated. <li>If still no method
 * is found, the event listener ignores the event </ol>

/**
 * Exception indicating that the changes in an aggregate (generated events) are ignored by the DisruptorCommandBus,
 * because it cannot guarantee that these changes have been applied to an aggregate instance with the correct state.
 * The DisruptorCommandBus will automatically recover by clearing cached information of blacklisted aggregates. Because
 * of the asynchronous nature of the DisruptorCommandBus, several commands may fail due to the same corrupt aggregate.
 * <p/>
 * When a corrupt aggregate has been detected, a {@link AggregateBlacklistedException} is thrown. Each subsequent time
 * state changes are applied to a blacklisted aggregate, an AggregateStateCorruptedException is thrown.
 * <p/>
 * It is generally safe to retry any commands that resulted in this exception, unless the cause is clearly
 * non-transient.

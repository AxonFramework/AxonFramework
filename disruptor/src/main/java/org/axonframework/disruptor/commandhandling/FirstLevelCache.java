/**
 * Works as an in-memory cache to keep a weak reference to the cached object,
 * which then allows the garbage collector to remove an object from memory once it isn't needed
 * anymore.
 * <p>
 * A {@link HashMap} doesn't help here since it will keep hard delegate for key and
 * value objects. A {@link WeakHashMap} doesn't either, because it keeps weak delegate to the
 * key objects, but we want to track the value objects.
 * <p>
 * This implementation which delegates to a {@link Map} uses a {@link WeakReference} for the values. Once the
 * garbage collector decides it wants to finalize a value, it will be removed from the
 * map automatically.
 * <p>
 * This implementation is heavily inspired by http://www.java2s.com/Code/Java/Collections-Data-Structure/WeakValueHashMap.htm

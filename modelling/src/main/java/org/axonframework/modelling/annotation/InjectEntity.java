/**
 * Annotation to be placed on a parameter of a {@link org.axonframework.messaging.annotation.MessageHandler} annotated
 * method that should receive an entity loaded from the {@link org.axonframework.modelling.StateManager}. The parameter
 * should be of the type of the entity to inject, or of a {@link org.axonframework.modelling.repository.ManagedEntity}
 * with the generic of the entity to inject.
 * <p>
 * The {@code idProperty} attribute can be used to specify the property of the message payload that contains the
 * identifier of the entity to inject. If not specified, the {@code idResolver} is used to resolve the identifier of the
 * entity to inject.
 * <p>
 * Unless a specific {@code idResolver} is specified, the {@link AnnotationBasedEntityIdResolver} is used to resolve the
 * entity id from the message. This is based on finding a {@link TargetEntityId} annotation on a field or
 * accessor method of the message payload.
 * <p>
 * So, identifiers will be resolved in the following order:
 * <ol>
 *     <li>From the property specified in {@code idProperty}.</li>
 *     <li>From the {@code idResolver}.</li>
 *     <li>From the {@link TargetEntityId} annotation on the message payload.</li>
 * </ol>

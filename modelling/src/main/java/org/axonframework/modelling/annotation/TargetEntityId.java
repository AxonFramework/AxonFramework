/**
 * Annotation to be placed on a parameter of a field or method of the payload of a
 * {@link org.axonframework.messaging.Message}, which provides the identifier of the target entity when using the
 * {@link AnnotationBasedEntityIdResolver}. See the {@link InjectEntity} annotation for more information about the
 * different ways to resolve the entity id when injecting entities into messsage handlers.
 * <p>
 * Multiple parameters annotated with {@link TargetEntityId} are allowed, but only one distinct non-null value may be
 * returned. If multiple non-null values are found that don't match, a {@link MultipleTargetEntityIdsFoundInPayload} is
 * thrown. If no non-null value is found, a {@link NoEntityIdFoundInPayload} is thrown.

/**
 * Interface describing an implementation of a Saga. Sagas are instances that handle events and may possibly produce
 * new commands or have other side effects. Typically, Sagas are used to manage long running business transactions.
 * <p/>
 * Multiple instances of a single type of Saga may exist. In that case, each Saga will be managing a different
 * transaction. Sagas need to be associated with concepts in order to receive specific events. These associations are
 * managed through AssociationValues. For example, to associate a saga with an Order with ID 1234, this saga needs an
 * association value with key {@code "orderId"} and value {@code "1234"}.

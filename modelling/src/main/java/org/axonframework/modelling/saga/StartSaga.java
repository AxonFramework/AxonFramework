 * definition:
 * <p/>
 * <code>@StartSaga(forceNew=true)<br/>@SagaEventHandler(associationProperty=&quot;orderId&quot;)<br/>public void
 * handleOrderCreated(OrderCreatedEvent event) </code><br/> will always trigger the creation of a saga that can be found
 * with an AssociationValue with key "orderId" and as value the value returned by {@code event.getOrderId()}.
 * <p/>
 * This annotation can only appear on methods that have been annotated with {@link
 * SagaEventHandler @SagaEventHandler}.

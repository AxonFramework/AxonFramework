/**
 * Method-level annotation indicating that the annotated method is an event handler method for the saga instance.
 * <p>
 * The parameters of the annotated method are resolved using parameter resolvers.
 * <p>
 * Axon provides a number of parameter resolvers that allow you to use the following parameter types:<ul> <li>The first
 * parameter is always the payload of the Event message</li> <li>Parameters annotated with {@code @MetaDataValue} will
 * resolve to the Meta Data value with the key as indicated on the annotation. If required is false (default), null is
 * passed when the meta data value is not present. If required is true, the resolver will not match and prevent the
 * method from being invoked when the meta data value is not present.</li> <li>Parameters of type {@link MetaData} will
 * have the entire Meta Data of an Event Message injected.</li> <li>Parameters of type {@link java.time.Instant} (or any
 * of its super classes or implemented interfaces) will resolve to the timestamp of the EventMessage. This is the time
 * at which the Event was generated.</li> <li>Parameters assignable to {@link Message} will have the entire {@link
 * EventMessage} injected (if the message is assignable to that parameter). If the first parameter is of type message,
 * it effectively matches an Event of any type, even if generic parameters would suggest otherwise. Due to type erasure,
 * Axon cannot detect what parameter is expected. In such case, it is best to declare a parameter of the payload type,
 * followed by a parameter of type Message.</li> <li>When using Spring and {@code &lt;axon:annotation-config/&gt;} is
 * declared, any other parameters will resolve to autowired beans, if exactly one autowire candidate is available in the
 * application context. This allows you to inject resources directly into {@code @SagaEventHandler} annotated
 * methods.</li> </ul>
 * <p/>
 * For each event, only a single annotated method will be invoked. This method is resolved in the following order <ol>
 * <li>First, the event handler methods of the actual class (at runtime) are searched <li>If a method is found with a
 * parameter that the domain event can be assigned to, it is marked as eligible <li>After a class  has been evaluated
 * (but before any super class), the most specific event handler method is called. That means that if an event handler
 * for a class A and one for a class B are eligible, and B is a subclass of A, then the method with a parameter of type
 * B will be chosen<li>If no method is found in the actual class, its super class is evaluated. <li>If still no method
 * is found, the event listener ignores the event </ol>

/**
 * Interface that describes a mechanism that enables the application of an additional event after another event is
 * applied.
 * <p>
 * The most common application of this mechanism is in the event handler method of an aggregate. Say that an event
 * handler for an event of type A applies another event of type B and then an event of type C. Only after the processing
 * of event A is finished will event B be applied to the aggregate. That means that the effects of event B will not
 * be visible from within the event handler. This is a problem if event C depends on the changes caused by
 * event B. The ApplyMore mechanism solves this problem by allowing clients to apply additional events after previous
 * events have been fully processed.
 * <p>
 * Be careful not to make any direct changes to the aggregate from the supplier of the subsequent event. If the
 * aggregate is event sourced this will cause the aggregate to be in an inconsistent state after event sourcing.

/**
 * Implementation of the Repository interface that takes provides a locking mechanism to prevent concurrent
 * modifications of persisted aggregates. Unless there is a locking mechanism present in the underlying persistence
 * environment, it is recommended to use a LockingRepository (or one of its subclasses).
 * <p/>
 * The LockingRepository can be initialized with a locking strategy. <em>Pessimistic Locking</em> is the default
 * strategy. Pessimistic Locking requires an exclusive lock to be handed to a thread loading an aggregate before the
 * aggregate is handed over. This means that, once an aggregate is loaded, it has full exclusive access to it, until it
 * saves the aggregate.
 * <p/>
 * Important: If an exception is thrown during the saving process, any locks held are released. The calling thread may
 * reattempt saving the aggregate again. If the lock is available, the thread automatically takes back the lock. If,
 * however, another thread has obtained the lock first, a ConcurrencyException is thrown.
 *
 * @param <T> The type that this aggregate stores

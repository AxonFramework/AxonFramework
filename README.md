# Axon Framework

<img src="https://www.axoniq.io/hubfs/axon-framework.svg" alt="Axon Framework logo" width="50" height="50">
The Axon Framework is an open source framework that's 100% Java and enables developers to build scalable and maintainable applications using a messaging-driven approach. It simplifies the complexities of developing distributed systems by providing a structured way to handle commands, events, and queries within your application.

At its core, the Axon Framework encourages an architecture where components communicate through messages, which promotes loose coupling and increases flexibility. This messaging system allows different parts of your application to interact without needing to know the internal workings of each other, making your system more modular and easier to manage.

One of the key features of the framework is its support for event sourcing, a pattern where state changes are recorded as a sequence of events. Instead of just storing the current state, every change is logged, providing a complete history of how the data arrived at its current form. This can be incredibly useful for auditing, debugging, and even recreating past states of your application when necessary.

Additionally, the Axon Framework facilitates the implementation of event-driven architectures. In this paradigm, components react to events as they occur, which can lead to more responsive and resilient systems. By processing events asynchronously, your application can handle high loads more effectively and remain responsive under stress.

For Java developers working with microservices, the Axon Framework offers tools to manage the complexities inherent in distributed systems. By leveraging its messaging and event-handling capabilities, you can build applications that are not only scalable and robust but also easier to extend and maintain over time.

## How to Get Started with Axon Framework

Numerous resources can help you on your journey in using Axon Framework.
A good starting point is [AxonIQ Documentation Portal](https://docs.axoniq.io/home/), which provides links to our tutorials, guides, and reference documentation.

Furthermore, below are several other helpful resources:
* [Read the tutorial](https://docs.axoniq.io/bikerental-demo/main/) on building a Bike Rental application from scratch
* [Watch our in-depth video training courses](https://academy.axoniq.io/)s in the AxonIQ Academy
* [Ask questions](https://discuss.axoniq.io/) in our help forum, Discuss.
* [See additional code samples](https://github.com/AxonIQ/code-samples) in our code samples repository 



# Axon Server

Axon Server is designed to simplify the development event-driven applications by acting as both an Event Store and a messaging platform. It serves as a central hub for managing and distributing events, commands, and queries within your application ecosystem. By handling these critical aspects, Axon Server allows developers to focus more on business logic rather than the complexities of communication and data storage in distributed systems.

When develping microservices, coordinating interactions between multiple services can become quite challenging, especially as the system scales. Axon Server addresses this by providing seamless and scalable message routing between services. It ensures that messages reach their intended targets and that events are efficiently broadcasted to all interested parties. 

In addition to functioning as a message router, Axon Server enables apps and services to be Event Sourced. Event Sourcing is a sofware pattern where all changes in the application state are stored as a sequence of events. Instead of just saving the current state, every state-changing action is recorded. This allows the application to reconstruct its state at any point in time by replaying these events. For developers unfamiliar with event sourcing, this means you have a complete history of what happened in your system, which is invaluable for debugging, auditing, and understanding complex behaviors.

Axon Server also facilitates the implementation of event-driven architectures. In this design paradigm, components of the system react to events as they occur rather than relying on direct calls or requests. This leads to a more decoupled and flexible system where services can operate and scale independently. For those new to event-driven concepts, it essentially means your application becomes more responsive and resilient, as services can handle events asynchronously and don't need to wait on each other to proceed.

By incorporating Axon Server into your applications, especially those built with microservices, you gain a robust platform for managing the flow of data and commands across your system. It abstracts the complexities of message handling and event storage, enabling you to build scalable, maintainable, and high-performing applications. This allows you to deliver features faster and adapt more readily to changing business requirements.

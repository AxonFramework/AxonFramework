    TCP based stack, with flow control and message bundling. This is usually used when IP
    multicasting cannot be used in a network, e.g. because it is disabled (routers discard multicast).
    Note that TCP.bind_addr and TCPPING.initial_hosts should be set, possibly via system properties, e.g.
    -Djgroups.bind_addr=192.168.5.2 and -Djgroups.tcpping.initial_hosts=192.168.5.2[7800]

 * A group of properties that allows easy configuration of the serializers used for different types of objects that

 * The Event serializer, if specified, is used to serialize the payload and meta-data of EventMessages as they are
 * stored in the event store and published. If no Event Serializer is specified, it defaults to the Message Serializer.
 * <p>
 * The Message Serializer is used to serialize the payload and meta-data of all messages and, where relevant, their
 * return values. Commands, Queries and Events, but also the Command Result and Query Responses are serialized using
 * this serializer. If no Message Serializer is specified, it defaults to the General Serializer.
 * <p>
 * The General Serializer is used to serialize the rest of the objects, such as TrackingTokens, Saga state,
 * Snapshot Events and all other data that needs to be serialized, but is not expected to be shared with other systems.
 * If no General Serializer is specified, it defaults to an XStream based serializer (see
 * {@link org.axonframework.serialization.xml.XStreamSerializer}).

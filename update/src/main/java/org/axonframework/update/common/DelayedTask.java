/**
 * A utility class to run a task with a delay in a virtual thread. The task can be checked for its status (started,
 * finished, failed), and the failure cause can be retrieved if it failed.
 * <p>
 * This has severely lower overhead than using a {@link java.util.concurrent.ScheduledExecutorService} or similar
 * constructs, as it does not require a thread pool or scheduling mechanism. It simply runs the task in a virtual thread
 * after the specified delay. The virtual thread is parked for the duration of the delay, and is executed on a carrier
 * thread when ready, which allows it to be lightweight and efficient.

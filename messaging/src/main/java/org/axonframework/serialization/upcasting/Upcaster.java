/**
 * Interface for Upcasters. An upcaster is the mechanism used to convert deprecated (typically serialized) objects and
 * convert them into the current format. If the serializer itself is not able to cope with the changed formats (XStream,
 * for example, will allow for some changes by using aliases), the Upcaster will allow you to configure more complex
 * structural transformations.
 * <p/>
 * Upcasters work on intermediate representations of the object to upcast. In some cases, this representation contains a
 * byte array, while in other cases they contain an object structure. For performance reasons, it is advisable to ensure
 * that all upcasters in the same upcaster chain (where one's output is another's input) use the same
 * intermediate representation content type.

     * <p>
     * To upcast an object an upcaster should apply a mapping function to the input stream ({@link
     * Stream#map(java.util.function.Function)}). To remove an object from the stream the upcaster should filter the
     * input stream ({@link Stream#filter(java.util.function.Predicate)}). To split an input object into more than one
     * objects use {@link Stream#flatMap(java.util.function.Function)}.
     * <p>
     * In some cases the upcasting result of an Upcaster may depend on more than one input object. In that case an
     * Upcaster may store state in the method during upcasting or even read ahead in the stream.

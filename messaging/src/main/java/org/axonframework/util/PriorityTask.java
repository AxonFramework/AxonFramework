/**
 * Represents a task such as {@link Runnable} or {@link Comparable} that adheres to a priority by implementing
 * {@link Comparable}. Uses a combination of {@code priority} and {@code index} to compare between {@code this} and
 * other {@link PriorityTask} instances. A calculator  (e.g.
 * {@link org.axonframework.commandhandling.CommandPriorityCalculator})  defines the priority of the task. This task
 * uses the {@code index} to differentiate between tasks with the same priority, ensuring the insert order is leading in
 * those scenarios.

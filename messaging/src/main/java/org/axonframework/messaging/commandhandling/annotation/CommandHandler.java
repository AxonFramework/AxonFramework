/**
 * Annotation to be placed on methods that can handle {@link CommandMessage commands}, thus making them
 * {@link org.axonframework.messaging.commandhandling.CommandHandler CommandHandlers}.
 * <p>
 * Command handler annotated methods are typically subscribed with a
 * {@link org.axonframework.messaging.commandhandling.CommandBus} as part of an
 * {@link AnnotatedCommandHandlingComponent}. This annotation can also be placed directly on entity children (read: an
 * entity contained in another entity) to have it handle the commands directly.
 * <p>
 * The parameters of the annotated method are resolved using parameter resolvers. Axon provides a number of parameter
 * resolvers that allow you to use the following parameter types:<ul>
 * <li>The first parameter is always the {@link CommandMessage#payload() payload} of the {@code CommandMessage}.
 * <li>Parameters annotated with {@link org.axonframework.messaging.core.annotation.MetadataValue} will resolve to the
 * {@link org.axonframework.messaging.core.Metadata} value with the key as indicated on the annotation. If required is
 * false (default), null is passed when the metadata value is not present. If required is true, the resolver will not
 * match and prevent the method from being invoked when the metadata value is not present.</li>
 * <li>Parameters of type {@code Metadata} will have the entire
 * {@link CommandMessage#metadata() command message metadata} injected.</li>
 * <li>Parameters assignable to {@link org.axonframework.messaging.core.Message} will have the entire {@link
 * CommandMessage} injected (if the message is assignable to that parameter). If the first parameter is of type message,
 * it effectively matches a command of any type. Due to type erasure, Axon cannot detect what parameter is expected. In
 * such case, it is best to declare a parameter of the payload type, followed by a parameter of type
 * {@code Message}.</li>
 * <li>A parameter of type {@link org.axonframework.messaging.core.unitofwork.ProcessingContext} will inject the active
 * processing context at that moment in time.</li>
 * </ul>

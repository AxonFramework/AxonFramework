/**
 * Manages the graceful shutdown of locally-initiated query streams, ensuring they are terminated
 * during application shutdown.
 * <p>
 * When an application shuts down, locally-initiated subscription queries and streaming queries
 * (those started on this node via {@link QueryBus#subscriptionQuery},
 * {@link org.axonframework.messaging.queryhandling.gateway.QueryGateway#subscriptionQuery}, or
 * {@link org.axonframework.messaging.queryhandling.gateway.QueryGateway#streamingQuery}) remain
 * open indefinitely unless explicitly closed. This prevents a web server from completing a graceful
 * shutdown, as active connections (e.g., SSE streams) are kept alive by the open query streams.
 * <p>
 * This manager solves the problem through explicit, call-level opt-in: callers wrap their
 * query streams or publishers using {@link #track(MessageStream)} or {@link #track(Publisher)},
 * and the manager closes them when {@link #shutdown()} is called.
 * <p>
 * Two shutdown policies are available:
 * <ul>
 *     <li><b>Close immediately</b>: all active subscriptions are terminated as soon as
 *     {@link #shutdown()} is called.</li>
 *     <li><b>Wait with grace period</b>: the manager waits up to a configurable duration for
 *     active subscriptions to complete naturally before force-closing any that remain. This is
 *     useful when some queries are short-lived and expected to complete on their own shortly
 *     after shutdown begins.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * For gateway-level tracking, use
 * {@link org.axonframework.messaging.core.configuration.MessagingConfigurer#registerQueryGateway(String, java.util.function.Consumer)},
 * which wires the manager into Axon's lifecycle automatically:
 * <pre>{@code
 * MessagingConfigurer.create()
 *     .registerQueryGateway("sse", g -> g
 *         .cancellingSubscriptionQueryOnShutdown(Duration.ofSeconds(10)));
 * }</pre>
 * For standalone use with call-site tracking, create the manager directly and register it with
 * Axon's lifecycle using {@link #registerShutdown(LifecycleRegistry)}:
 * <pre>{@code
 * QueryShutdownManager manager = QueryShutdownManager.withGracePeriod(Duration.ofSeconds(5));
 * configurer.lifecycleRegistry(manager::registerShutdown);
 * }</pre>
 * <p>
 * When call-site tracking is needed, for example when multiple managers are defined or when
 * using the query bus directly, wrap results explicitly with {@link #track(MessageStream)} or
 * {@link #track(Publisher)}:
 * <pre>{@code
 * // Via query gateway (returns Publisher<T>):
 * Publisher<MyDto> stream = shutdownManager.track(
 *     queryGateway.subscriptionQuery(new MyQuery(), MyDto.class)
 * );
 *
 * // Via query bus directly (returns MessageStream<T>):
 * MessageStream<QueryResponseMessage> stream = shutdownManager.track(
 *     queryBus.subscriptionQuery(query, null, 100)
 * );
 * }</pre>

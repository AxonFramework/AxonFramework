/**
 * {@link MessageStream} decorator that re-enters a span's {@link SpanScope} via
 * {@link SpanScope#within(java.util.function.Supplier)} around every pull of the delegate stream.
 * <p>
 * A branch-scoped span's initial scope window covers the synchronous invocation of the operation (see
 * {@link Span#branchStream}), but parts of the operation may execute only when its result stream is <em>drained</em> --
 * most notably a reactive handler returning a {@code Flux}, which is subscribed lazily on the stream's first pull.
 * Re-entering the scope around every pull lets provider-specific context-capture mechanisms observe the operation's
 * span when lazy work starts and restore it around downstream callbacks.
 * <p>
 * The wrapped scope's lifecycle is not managed here: closing rides on the composition in
 * {@link Span#branchStream(
 * org.axonframework.messaging.core.unitofwork.ProcessingContext, java.util.function.Function)}.

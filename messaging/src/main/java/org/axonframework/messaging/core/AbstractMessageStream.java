/**
 * Abstract base implementation of {@link MessageStream} that provides full state management for
 * consumption, completion, error propagation, closing, and callback coordination.
 * <p>
 * This implementation enforces a non-blocking, pull-based consumption model with optional
 * callback-driven signaling. Consumers invoke {@link #next()} to attempt to retrieve entries.
 * When no entry is available at that time, the stream may enter an <i>awaiting data</i> state.
 * In this state, the stream expects an external signal indicating that progress may be possible again.
 * <p>
 * Implementations must provide data through {@link #fetchNext()}, which returns a
 * {@link FetchResult} describing the current availability:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>{@link FetchResult.Value} - an entry is available</li>
 *     <li>{@link FetchResult.NotReady} - no entry is currently available, but more may arrive</li>
 *     <li>{@link FetchResult.Completed} - the stream is exhausted and will produce no further entries</li>
 *     <li>{@link FetchResult.Error} - the stream has failed with an error</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Returning {@link FetchResult.NotReady} transitions the stream into an <i>awaiting data</i> state.
 * Implementations are expected to invoke {@link #signalProgress()} when new data may be available,
 * or when the stream completes or fails asynchronously. This will trigger the registered callback
 * if the consumer is awaiting data. It is safe to invoke {@code signalProgress()} even if the stream
 * is not awaiting data; such calls are ignored.
 * <p>
 * The registered callback (see {@link #setCallback(Runnable)}) is invoked when:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>entries may be available for consumption,</li>
 *     <li>the stream completes (normally or exceptionally)</li>
 * </ul>
 * Invocation of the callback does not guarantee that entries are available; consumers must
 * always re-check the stream using {@link #next()}, {@link #peek()}, {@link #isCompleted()},
 * and {@link #error()}.
 * <p>
 * This class enforces a strict non-blocking contract: {@link #fetchNext()} must never block.
 * If no data is currently available, implementations must return {@link FetchResult.NotReady}
 * and rely on {@link #signalProgress()} to indicate future availability.
 * <p>
 * Stream completion is terminal. Once a {@link FetchResult.Completed} or {@link FetchResult.Error}
 * is returned, the stream will not produce further entries. Implementations must signal completion
 * exclusively via {@link #fetchNext()}; they should not invoke {@link #close()} directly unless
 * acting as a consumer of another (sub)stream they own.
 * <p>
 * If the registered callback throws an exception, the stream is completed exceptionally with that
 * error, unless the callback was called to signal completion. This ensures that failures in progress
 * signaling do not leave the stream in an unusable state.
 * <p>
 * Implementations may optionally initialize the stream state during construction using
 * {@link #initialize(FetchResult)}. If not invoked explicitly, the stream is implicitly initialized
 * on first interaction with a {@link FetchResult.NotReady} state. Initialization may only occur once
 * and cannot use {@link FetchResult.Value}.
 * <p>
 * This class is thread-safe; all state transitions are guarded to support concurrent interaction
 * between producers and consumers.
 * <p>
 * Subclasses may override {@link #onCompleted()} to perform cleanup when the stream reaches a
 * terminal state.
 * <p>
 * All methods in this class are either {@code final}, {@code private}, {@code abstract} or empty to
 * protect its invariants.
 *
 * @param <M> The type of {@link Message} contained in the {@link MessageStream.Entry entries} of this stream.

     * Concurrency model:
     *
     * This class uses synchronized for all state access instead of Atomics or explicit Locks.
     *
     * Lock direction: consumer-side calls (next, peek, hasNextAvailable, setCallback, close)
     * acquire locks from outer to inner (downstream). Producer-side signals (signalProgress and
     * the callbacks they trigger) flow in the opposite direction: inner to outer (upstream).
     * To prevent deadlock, signalProgress releases its lock before invoking the callback rather
     * than holding it across the call.
     *
     * Ordering requirement: signalProgress() must only be called after the state change it
     * announces is fully visible via fetchNext(). This ensures that if a signal arrives while
     * awaitingData is false (the consumer has not yet entered the waiting state), the consumer
     * will still observe the updated state on its next fetchNext() call without needing a retry
     * or a repeated signal. See signalProgress() for details.
     *
     * Rationale:
     * - Multiple fields (callback, peekedEntry, error, completed, awaitingData) form a single
     *   logical state. Guarding them with a single monitor ensures consistency and avoids
     *   subtle race conditions that can occur when combining multiple atomic variables.
     * - This approach is easier to reason about and verify for correctness: all state
     *   transitions happen under one lock.
     * - Expected contention is low (typically one producer and one consumer), and all
     *   operations are short and non-blocking, making the cost of synchronization negligible
     *   on modern JVMs.
     *
     * If future profiling shows contention or scalability issues, this design can be revisited
     * and optimized in a targeted manner.

     * <p>
     * The output is designed for debugging complex stream compositions and focuses on

     * <ul>
     *     <li><b>Lifecycle status</b> (terminal or transitional state)</li>
     *     <li><b>Transient flags</b> (abnormal or noteworthy conditions)</li>
     *     <li><b>Delegation structure</b> (wrapped or composed streams)</li>
     * </ul>
     *
     * <h3>Format</h3>
     * The general structure is:
     * <pre>
     * SimpleName[status|P|flags]{delegates}
     * </pre>
     *
     * <h3>Status section</h3>
     * The status reflects the current terminal or transitional condition:
     * <ul>
     *     <li>{@code ERROR} – the stream completed exceptionally</li>
     *     <li>{@code COMPLETED} – the stream completed normally</li>
     *     <li>{@code NOT_READY} – the stream is awaiting data</li>
     *     <li>absent – stream is in its normal active state</li>
     * </ul>
     *
     * <h3>Additional markers</h3>
     * <ul>
     *     <li>{@code P} – indicates a peeked entry is currently buffered</li>
     *     <li>{@link #describeFlags()} – optional subtype-specific diagnostic flags
     *     separated by {@code "|"}, only used for abnormal or noteworthy conditions</li>
     * </ul>
     *
     * <h3>Flags</h3>
     * Flags are intended for rare or abnormal conditions only, not normal operating state.
     * They should be short, human-readable identifiers separated by {@code "|"}.
     * If no flags are present, this section is omitted.
     *
     * <h3>Delegates</h3>
     * Delegates describe wrapped or composed streams that this stream builds upon.
     * Multiple delegates are comma-separated. The currently active delegate must be
     * prefixed with {@code "*"}.
     * <p>
     * This allows reconstruction of the stream pipeline structure for debugging purposes.

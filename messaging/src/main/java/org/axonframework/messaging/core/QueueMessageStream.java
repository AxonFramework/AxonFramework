/**
 * A {@link MessageStream} implementation backed by a {@link BlockingQueue}.
 * <p>
 * This stream acts as a bridge between a producer and a consumer:
 * {@link MessageStream.Entry entries} are {@link #offer(Message, Context) offered} into an
 * internal queue and consumed via the {@link MessageStream} API.
 * <p>
 * The stream supports both finite and dynamically produced sequences:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>While open, the stream may temporarily have no elements available,
 *     in which case consumption methods may indicate a "not ready" state.</li>
 *     <li>Once {@link #seal()} or {@link #sealExceptionally(Throwable)} is invoked,
 *     no further elements are accepted. Remaining buffered elements can still
 *     be consumed.</li>
 *     <li>After the queue is drained, the stream completes normally or
 *     exceptionally depending on how it was sealed.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * If a callback is registered via {@link #setCallback(Runnable)}, it is invoked
 * when new elements become available. If the callback throws an exception, the
 * stream transitions to an error state immediately and any buffered elements
 * are discarded.
 *
 * @param <M> The type of {@link Message} contained in this stream.

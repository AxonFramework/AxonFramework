/**
 * Implementation of a {@link LockFactory} that uses a pessimistic locking strategy. Calls to
 * {@link #obtainLock} will block until a lock could be obtained or back off limit is reached, based on the
 * settings provided, by throwing an exception. The latter will cause the command to fail, but will allow
 * the calling thread to be freed. If a lock is obtained by a thread, that thread has guaranteed unique access.
 * <p/>
 * Each thread can hold the same lock multiple times. The lock will only be released for other threads when the lock
 * has been released as many times as it was obtained.
 * <p/>
 * This lock can be used to ensure thread safe access to a number of objects, such as Aggregates and Sagas.

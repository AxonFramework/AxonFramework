/**
 * An {@link EventProcessor} which processes an event stream in segments. Segmenting the stream of events allows for
 * parallelization of event processing, effectively enhancing the processing speed.
 * <p>
 * A {@link StreamingEventProcessor} uses a {@link TokenStore} to store the progress of each of the segments it is
 * processing. Furthermore, it allows for segment interactions like:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>{@link #releaseSegment(int)} - release a segment processed by this processor</li>
 *     <li>{@link #splitSegment(int)} - increase the number of segments by splitting one into two</li>
 *     <li>{@link #mergeSegment(int)} - decrease the number of segments by merging two segments into one</li>
 *     <li>{@link #resetTokens()} - adjust the positions of all segments for this processor to the beginning of the event stream</li>
 *     <li>{@link #processingStatus()} - return the {@link EventTrackerStatus} of every segment processed by this instance</li>
 * </ul>

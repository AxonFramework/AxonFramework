/**
 * Represents a part of the application logic that will be traced. One or multiple spans together form a trace and are
 * often used to debug and monitor (distributed) applications.
 * <p>
 * The {@link Span} is an abstraction for Axon Framework to have tracing capabilities without knowing the specific
 * tracing provider. Calling {@link #start()} will start the {@code span} and make it active to the current thread. For
 * every start invocation, a respective {@link #end()} should be called as well to prevent scope leaks.
 * <p>
 * Creating {@link Span spans} is the responsibility of the {@link SpanFactory} which should be implemented by the
 * tracing provider of choice.
 * <p>
 * Important! In order to make this span the parent for any new span created during its execution,
 * {@link #makeCurrent()} should be called. This method will return a {@link SpanScope}, on which
 * {@link SpanScope#close()} should be invoked during the same code execution on the same thread. If not, this span will
 * become the unwanted parent of any children. You can make the same span the current for multiple threads at any point
 * in time, as long as you close them before calling {@link Span#end()}
 * <p>
 * Each {@link #start()} should eventually result in an {@link #end()} being called, but this does not have to be done
 * on the same thread.
 *
 * @author Mitchell Herrijgers
 * @see SpanFactory For more information about creating different kinds of traces.

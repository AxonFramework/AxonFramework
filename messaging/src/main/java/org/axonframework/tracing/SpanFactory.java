/**
 * The {@link SpanFactory} is responsible for making {@link Span spans} in a way the chosen tracing provider is
 * compatible with.
 * <p>
 * Each span has an operation name and span kind. From the operation name it should be clear what is happening in the
 * application. For example, use {@code "ClassName.method MessageName"} to indicate a message payload being handled.
 *
 * <p>
 * Spans can have tags, which are provided by {@link SpanAttributesProvider SpanAttributesProviders}. By default, any
 * time a message is used while creating a span should invoke all configured
 * {@link SpanAttributesProvider SpanAttributesProviders} and set those tags on the created span.
 *
 * <p>
 * The factory should support these types of spans:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>New root trace spans: These create an entirely new trace without parent. Use this for asynchronous calls that we want to measure the performance individually of. For example, snapshotting (which has no influence on a business process).</li>
 *     <li>New handler spans: This creates a new span in an already existing trace. The span that was active when the message was dispatched will be linked to it. It will be of the handling type</li>
 *     <li>New dispatch spans: This creates a new span in an already existing trace. It will be of a dispatching type. </li>
 *     <li>New internal span: This creates a new sub-span in an already active span. Use this for measuring individual parts of an already existing span. For example, measuring how long it takes to load the aggregate when handling an event.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Check the individual method's javadoc more information on each type.

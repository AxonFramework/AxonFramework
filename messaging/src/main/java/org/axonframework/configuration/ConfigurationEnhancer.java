/**
 * Interface describing an enhancement of the {@link ComponentRegistry} from the Axon Framework configuration API,
 * taking effect during {@link ApplicationConfigurer#build() build} of the configurer.
 * <p>
 * Through implementing the {@link #enhance(ComponentRegistry)} operation a {@code ConfigurationEnhancer} is able to
 * {@link ComponentRegistry#registerComponent(Class, ComponentFactory) register} components and
 * {@link ComponentRegistry#registerDecorator(Class, int, ComponentDecorator) register} decorators. The registration of
 * components and/or decorators can be made conditional by using the {@link ComponentRegistry#hasComponent(Class)}
 * operation.
 * <p>
 * Note that enhancers have an {@link #order()} in which they enhance the {@code Configurer}. When not otherwise
 * specified, the order defaults to {@code 0}. Thus, without specifying the order, the insert order of enhancer dictates
 * the order.

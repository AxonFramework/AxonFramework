     * <p>
     * Decorating can roughly take two angles. One, it may choose to wrap the {@code delegate} into a new instance of
     * type {@code C}. Second, it could mutate the state of the {@code delegate}.
     * <p>
     * Option one would typically apply to infrastructure components that support decorators. An example of this is the
     * {@link org.axonframework.commandhandling.CommandBus}, which can for example be decorated with the
     * {@link org.axonframework.commandhandling.tracing.TracingCommandBus}.
     * <p>
     * The latter form is suitable when customizing the configuration instance of an infrastructure component.
     *
     * @param config   The configuration of this Axon application. Provided to support retrieval of other
     *                 {@link NewConfiguration#getComponent(Class) components} for construction or mutation of the given
     *                 {@code delegate}.
     * @param name     The name of the component to decorated.
     * @param delegate The delegate of type {@code C} to be decorated.
     * @return A decorated component of type {@code C}, typically based on the given {@code delegate}.

/**

 * <p>
 * A {@code SageLifecycle} is a {@link ProcessingContext}-scoped replacement for the Axon Framework 4
 * {@code SagaLifecycle}, which exposed the very same operations as {@code static} methods resolved through a
 * {@code ThreadLocal}. A {@code SagaLifecycle} instance is only reachable through the {@code ProcessingContext} that is
 * active while a specific Saga instance handles a specific event.
 * <p>
 * To access the {@code SageLifecycle}, declare a {@code SagaLifecycle}-typed parameter on a
 * {@link SagaEventHandler @SagaEventHandler} method:
 * <pre>{@code
 * @SagaEventHandler(associationProperty = "orderId")
 * public void on(OrderShippedEvent event, SagaLifecycle lifecycle) {
 *     lifecycle.associateWith("shipmentId", event.getShipmentId());
 *     lifecycle.end();
 * }

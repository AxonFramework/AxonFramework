/**
 * A functional interface representing a listener that is notified when a {@link TopologyChange} occurs to a specific
 * {@link AxonServerConfiguration#getContext() context}.
 * <p>
 * A {@code TopologyChange} can reflect any of the following {@link TopologyChange#type() updates}:
 * <ol>
 *     <li>{@link org.axonframework.axonserver.connector.TopologyChange.Type#COMMAND_HANDLER_ADDED} - A <b>command</b> handler was added by a specific instance to the context the listener is attached to.</li>
 *     <li>{@link org.axonframework.axonserver.connector.TopologyChange.Type#COMMAND_HANDLER_REMOVED} - A <b>command</b> handler was removed from a specific instance for the context the listener is attached to.</li>
 *     <li>{@link org.axonframework.axonserver.connector.TopologyChange.Type#QUERY_HANDLER_ADDED} - A <b>query</b> handler was added by a specific instance to the context the listener is attached to.</li>
 *     <li>{@link org.axonframework.axonserver.connector.TopologyChange.Type#QUERY_HANDLER_REMOVED} - A <b>query</b> handler was removed from a specific instance for the context the listener is attached to.</li>
 *     <li>{@link org.axonframework.axonserver.connector.TopologyChange.Type#RESET} - This signals the connection broke down of a specific instance for the context the listener is attached to.</li>
 * </ol>
 * <p>
 * A {@code TopologyChange} includes more information to better comprehend the actual change, being:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>{@link TopologyChange#type() The type} - The type of update.</li>
 *     <li>{@link TopologyChange#context() The context} - The context from which the change originates.</li>
 *     <li>{@link TopologyChange#clientId() The client id} - The {@link AxonServerConfiguration#getClientId() identifier of the client} for which a topology change occurred.</li>
 *     <li>{@link TopologyChange#clientStreamId() The client stream id} - The identifier of the stream/connection for a client (e.g., the Axon Framework node) for which a topology change occurred, defined by Axon Server.</li>
 *     <li>{@link TopologyChange#componentName() The component name} - The {@link AxonServerConfiguration#getComponentName() name of the component} for which a topology change occurred.</li>
 *     <li>{@link TopologyChange#handler() The handler subscription} - The handler subscription containing the {@link TopologyChange.HandlerSubscription#name()} and an optional {@link TopologyChange.HandlerSubscription#loadFactor()} that is only present for command handler subscriptions.</li>
 * </ul>
 * Here is an example {@link TopologyChange#toString()} for a {@link org.axonframework.axonserver.connector.TopologyChange.Type#COMMAND_HANDLER_ADDED}:
 * <pre>{@code
 * TopologyChange{
 *     type=COMMAND_HANDLER_ADDED,
 *     context='axoniq-university',
 *     clientId='149466@axoniq-uni',
 *     clientStreamId='149466@axoniq-uni.2bb5c0b4-59d9-4396-ad14-a32059f71d9a',
 *     componentName='AxonIQ University',
 *     handlerSubscription=HandlerSubscription{
 *         name='io.axoniq.demo.university.faculty.write.createcourse.CreateCourse',
 *         loadFactor=100
 *     }
 * }
 * }</pre>
 * <p>
 * An example use case of this functional interface, is to get notified when a new instance connects or disconnects. A
 * newly connecting instance would mean a new {@link TopologyChange#clientStreamId()} entered, while a disconnect is
 * signaled by the {@link TopologyChange.Type#RESET} {@link TopologyChange#type()}. Such a coarse topology change means the
 * routing of commands will change, which impacts {@link org.axonframework.common.caching.Cache} hits for your
 * aggregates or sagas, for example.
 * <p>
 * Registering this interface with the {@link org.axonframework.config.Configurer} will ensure it is registered with the
 * {@link AxonServerConfiguration#getContext() default context} <b>only</b>! If you need to register several change
 * listeners, either with the same context or with different contexts, you are required to retrieve the
 * {@link io.axoniq.axonserver.connector.control.ControlChannel} from the {@code AxonServerConnectionManager} manually,
 * and invoke {@link io.axoniq.axonserver.connector.control.ControlChannel#registerTopologyChangeHandler(Consumer)} for
 * each change listener separately.
 * <p>
 * Note that Axon Server 2025.1.2 or up is required to use this feature!

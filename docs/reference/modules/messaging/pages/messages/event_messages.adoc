This document provides information about the design, implementation, and intended usage of event messages in Axon Framework.

== Design considerations

Events are specific type of messages, used to notify something has happened. To distinguish them from other message types, the framework must provide a dedicates objects.

In addition to the generic messages, event messages have the following characteristics:

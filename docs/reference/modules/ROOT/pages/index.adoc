= Axon Framework Documentation 

Welcome to the Axon Framework's documentation. It provides information about the modules and components of the framework, their purpose, and their intended use.

Axon Framework alone significantly simplifies the software development process of JVM-based applications. However, it adds even more value when used in combination with other products of the Axon family.

== Documentation structure

The documentation contains the specifics of the framework's functionality, objects, interfaces, etc. It's a convenient, quick-access reference answering questions like "What's X?", "What's X used for?", "How's X implemented?" etc. Thus it closely follows the structure of Axon Framework's source code. Such an approach makes it easier to quickly navigate to any specific element.

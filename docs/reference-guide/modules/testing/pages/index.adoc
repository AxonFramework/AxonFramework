Testing is a critical part of developing reliable applications.
Axon Framework's testing module provides comprehensive tools for testing either your entire application or parts of your application.
As such, it allows focus on just your command handlers and entities, but can also be used for complete integration tests.

The testing support is built on a simple principle: use the same configuration in your tests as you do in production.
This approach eliminates duplicate configuration and ensures your tests accurately reflect your production setup.

The `AxonTestFixture` is the main entry point for testing Axon applications.
It uses the same `ApplicationConfigurer` that you use to configure your production application, providing consistency between test and production environments.

Once the configuration is inserted in the fixture, you're presented with a given-when-then style to describe and test your scenarios.
Furthermore, in taking the overarching configuration, the testing module supports testing all aspects of your application:

**Command handler testing**::
Test command handling logic, validation rules, and state changes.
Verify that commands produce the expected events and results.

**Event handler testing**::
Test event handling and side effects.
Verify that events trigger the correct commands, queries, or additional events.

**Entity testing**::
Test event-sourced entities and business logic.

**Integration testing**::
Test complete message flows with real infrastructure components.
Verify end-to-end behavior including conversion, event storage, and processors.

**Side effect testing**::
Validate commands and events dispatched as side effects during message handling.

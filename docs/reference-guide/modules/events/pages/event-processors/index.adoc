xref:event-handlers.adoc[Event handlers] define the business logic to be performed when an event is received.
_Event Processors_ are the components that take care of the technical aspects of that processing.
They create a xref:messaging-concepts:unit-of-work.adoc[ProcessingContext] and possibly start a transaction.
They also ensure that xref:messaging-concepts:message-correlation.adoc[correlation data] can be correctly attached to all messages created during event processing, among other non-functional requirements.

The image below depicts a representation of the organization of Event Processors and Event Handlers:

image::event-processors.png[Organization of Event Processors and Event Handlers]

Axon has a layered approach towards organizing event handlers.
First, an event handler is positioned in a _Processing Group_.
Each event handler, or "Event Handling Component," will only ever belong to a single Processing Group.
The Processing Group provides a level of configurable non-functional requirements, like <<event-processor-error-handler,error handling>> and the xref:event-processors/streaming.adoc#sequential-processing[sequencing policy].

The Event Processor, in turn, is in charge of the Processing Group.
An Event Processor will control 1 to N Processing Groups, although there will be a one-to-one mapping in most cases.
Similar to the Event Handling Component, a Processing Group will belong to a single Event Processor.
This last layer allows the definition of the type of Event Processor used and concepts like the threading model and a more fine-grained degree of <<event-processor-error-handler,error handling>>.

Event Processors come in roughly two forms: xref:event-processors/subscribing.adoc[Subscribing] and xref:event-processors/streaming.adoc[Streaming].

== Message delivery models

The key difference between processor types lies in how messages are delivered:

**SubscribableMessageSource** (push model)::
The message source actively notifies consumers when messages become available and pushes them to registered processors.
The source controls when messages are delivered.

**StreamableEventSource** (pull model)::
The processor actively requests messages from the source based on its own processing capacity.
The consumer controls when messages are retrieved.

The processor implementation itself determines which thread is used for event handling.
A xref:event-processors/subscribing.adoc[Subscribing Event Processor] typically processes events synchronously after receiving them from the source, while a xref:event-processors/streaming.adoc[Streaming Processor] uses dedicated worker threads to decouple message retrieval from message processing.

For more specifics on either type, consult their respective sections xref:event-processors/subscribing.adoc[here] and xref:event-processors/streaming.adoc[here].
The rest of this page dedicates itself to describing the Event Processor's common concepts and configuration options.
Note that throughout, the `EventProcessingConfigurer` is used.
The `EventProcessingConfigurer` is part of Axon's Configuration API, dedicated to configuring Event Processors.

== Assigning handlers to processors

All processors have a name, which identifies a processor instance across JVM instances.
Two processors with the same name are considered as two instances of the same processor.

All event handlers are attached to a processor whose name by default is the package name of the event handler's class.
Furthermore, the default processor implementation used by Axon is the xref:event-processors/streaming.adoc[Tracking Event Processor].
The (default) event processor used can be adjusted, as is shown in the xref:event-processors/subscribing.adoc#configuring[subscribing] and xref:event-processors/streaming.adoc#configuring[streaming] sections.

Event handlers, or Event Handling Components, come in roughly two flavors: "regular" (singleton, stateless) event handlers and xref:sagas:index.adoc[sagas].
xref:event-handlers.adoc#registering-event-handlers[This] section describes the process to register an event handler, whereas xref:sagas:implementation.adoc#configuring-a-saga[this] page describes the saga registration process.

Now let us consider that the following event handlers have been registered:

* `org.axonframework.example.eventhandling.MyHandler`
* `org.axonframework.example.eventhandling.MyOtherHandler`
* `org.axonframework.example.eventhandling.module.ModuleHandler`

Without any intervention, this will trigger the creation of two processors, namely:

. `org.axonframework.example.eventhandling` with two handlers called `MyHandler` and `MyOtherHandler`
. `org.axonframework.example.eventhandling.module` with the single handler `ModuleHandler`

Using the package name serves as a suitable default, but using dedicated names for an Event Processor and/or the Processing Group is recommended.
The most straightforward approach to reaching a transparent naming scheme of your event handlers is by using the `ProcessingGroup` annotation.
This annotation resembles the Processing Group level discussed in the <<Event Processors,introduction>>.

The `ProcessingGroup` annotation requires the insertion of a name and can only be set on the class.
Let us adjust the previous sample by using this annotation instead of the package names for grouping handlers:

[source,java]
----
@ProcessingGroup("my-handlers")
class MyHandler {
    // left out event handling functions...
}

@ProcessingGroup("my-handlers")
class MyOtherHandler{
    // ...
}

@ProcessingGroup("module-handlers")
class ModuleHandler {
    // ...
}

----

Using the `ProcessingGroup` annotation as depicted, we again construct two processors:

. `my-handlers` with two handlers called `MyHandler` and `MyOtherHandler`
. `module-handlers` with the single handler `ModuleHandler`

If more control is required to group Event Handling Components, we recommend consulting the <<Event handler assignment rules,assignment rules>> section.

=== Event handler assignment rules

The Configuration API allows you to configure other strategies for assigning event handling classes to processors or assigning specific handler instances to particular processors.
We can separate these assignment rules into roughly two groups: Event Handler to Processing Group and Processing Group to Event Processor.
Below is an exhaustive list of all the assignment rules the `EventProcessingConfigurer` exposes:

*Event Handler to Processing Group*

* `byDefaultAssignTo(String)`: defines the default Processing Group name to assign an event handler to.
It will only be taken into account if there are no more specifics rules and if the `ProcessingGroup` annotation is not present.
* `byDefaultAssignHandlerInstancesTo(Function<Object, String>)`: defines a lambda invoked to assign an event handling instance to a desired Processing Group by returning that group's name.
It will only be taken into account if there are no more specifics rules and if the `ProcessingGroup` annotation is not present.
* `byDefaultAssignHandlerTypesTo(Function<Class<?>, String>)`: defines a lambda invoked to assign an event handler type to a desired Processing Group by returning that group's name.
It will only be taken into account if there are no more specifics rules and if the `ProcessingGroup` annotation is not present.
* `assignHandlerInstancesMatching(String, Predicate<Object>)`: assigns event handlers to the given Processing Group name based on a predicate ingesting an event handling instance.
The operation uses a natural priority of zero.
If an instance matches several criteria, the outcome is _undefined_.
* `assignHandlerTypesMatching(String, Predicate<Class<?>>)`: assigns event handlers to the given Processing Group name based on a predicate ingesting an event handler type.
The operation uses a natural priority of zero.
If an instance matches several criteria, the outcome is _undefined_.
* `assignHandlerInstancesMatching(String, int, Predicate<Object>)`: assigns event handlers to the given Processing Group name based on a predicate ingesting an event handling instance.
Uses the given priority to decide on rule-ordering.
The higher the priority value, the more important the rule is.
If an instance matches several criteria, the outcome is _undefined_.
* `assignHandlerTypesMatching(String, int, Predicate<Class<?>>)`: assigns event handlers to the given Processing Group name based on a predicate ingesting an event handler type.
Uses the given priority to decide on rule-ordering.
The higher the priority, the more important the rule is.
If an instance matches several criteria, the outcome is _undefined_.

*Processing Group to Event Processor*

* `assignProcessingGroup(String, String)`: defines a given Processing Group name that belongs to the given Event Processor's name.
* `assignProcessingGroup(Function<String, String>)`: defines a lambda invoked to assign a Processing Group name to the desired Event Processor by returning that processor's name.

=== Ordering event handlers within a processor

To order event handlers within an Event Processor, the order in which event handlers are registered (as described in the xref:event-handlers.adoc#registering-event-handlers[Registering Event Handlers] section) is guiding.
Thus, the ordering in which an Event Processor will call event handlers for event handling is the same as their insertion ordering in the Configuration API.

If we use Spring as the mechanism for wiring everything, we can explicitly specify the event handler component ordering by adding the `@Order` annotation.
This annotation is placed on the event handler class name, containing an `integer` value to specify the ordering.

Note that it is *not possible* to order event handlers belonging to different Event Processors.
Each Event Processor acts as an isolated component without any intervention from other Event Processors.

[NOTE]
.Ordering Event Handlers within a Processor
====

Although we can place an order among event handlers within an Event Processor, separation of event handlers is recommended.

Placing an overall ordering on event handlers means those components are inclined to interact with one another, introducing a form of coupling.
Due to this, the event handling process will become complex to manage (for example, for new team members).
Furthermore, embracing an ordering approach might lead to place _all_ event handlers in a global ordering, decreasing processing speeds in general.

In all, you are free to use an ordering, but we recommend using it sparingly.
====

[[error-handling]]
== Error handling

Errors are inevitable in any application.
Depending on where they happen, you may want to respond differently.

By default, exceptions raised by event handlers are handled by the <<event-processor-error-handler,error handler>>.
The default error handler (`PropagatingErrorHandler`) will rethrow exceptions, causing the processor to enter error mode.
Exceptions thrown when a processor is trying to commit a transaction, update a xref:event-processors/streaming.adoc#token-store[token], or in any other part of the process, are also propagated to the error handler.

In the case of a xref:event-processors/streaming.adoc#error-mode[Streaming Event Processor], this means the processor will go into error mode, releasing any tokens and retrying at an incremental interval (starting at 1 second, up to max 60 seconds).
A xref:event-processors/subscribing.adoc#error-mode[Subscribing Event Processor] will report a publication error to the component that provided the event.

To change this behavior, both the Processing Group and Event Processor level allow customization on how to deal with exceptions:

[[event-processor-error-handler]]
=== Event processor: Error handler

Exceptions occurring outside an event handler's scope, or have bubbled up from there, are handled by the `ErrorHandler`.
The default error handler is the `PropagatingErrorHandler`, which will rethrow any exceptions it catches.

How the Event Processor deals with a rethrown exception differ per implementation.
The behaviour for the Subscribing- and the Streaming Event Processor can respectively be found xref:event-processors/subscribing.adoc#error-mode[here] and xref:event-processors/streaming.adoc#error-mode[here].

You can configure a default `ErrorHandler` for all Event Processors or override it for specific processors:

[tabs]
====
Configuration API::
+
--

[source,java]
----
public class AxonConfig {
    public void configure(EventProcessingConfigurer configurer) {
        // Configure a default error handler for all processors
        configurer
            .defaults((config, processorConfig) -> processorConfig
                .errorHandler(new MyCustomErrorHandler())
            );

        // Or configure for a specific processor
        configurer
            .pooledStreaming(pooledStreaming ->
                pooledStreaming.processor("my-processor", processor -> processor
                    .eventHandlingComponents(components -> components
                        .autodetected(cfg -> myEventHandler)
                    )
                    .customized((config, processorConfig) -> processorConfig
                        .errorHandler(new MySpecificErrorHandler())
                    )
                )
            );
    }
}
----
--
====

For providing a custom solution, the `ErrorHandler`'s single method needs to be implemented:

[source,java]
----
public interface ErrorHandler {

    void handleError(ErrorContext errorContext) throws Exception;
}
----

Based on the provided `ErrorContext` object, you can decide to ignore the error, schedule retries, perform dead-letter-queue delivery, or rethrow the exception.

[[dead-letter-queue]]
=== Dead-letter queue

Although configuring a <<listener-invocation-error-handler,Listener Invocation Error Handler>>
and <<event-processor-error-handler,Error Handler>>
helps you to deal with exceptions when processing events, you still end up in an event handling stop.
When you only log the error and allow processing to proceed, you will most likely end up with missing data until you fix the predicament and xref:event-processors/streaming.adoc#replaying-events[replay]
past events.
If you instead propagate the exception so the event processor keeps retrying, the event processor will stall entirely when the cause is consistent.

Although this behavior is sufficient on many occasions, sometimes it is beneficial if we can unblock event handling by parking the problematic event.
This is where the Dead-letter Queue comes in. It is a mechanism to park events until they can be processed successfully.
You can find more information in the xref:axon-framework-reference:events:event-processors/dead-letter-queue.adoc[] section.

[[general_processor_configuration]]
== General processor configuration

Alongside <<Assigning handlers to processors,handler assignment>> and <<Error handling,error handling>>, Event Processors allow configuration for other components too.
For xref:event-processors/subscribing.adoc#configuring[Subscribing] and xref:event-processors/streaming.adoc#configuring[Streaming] Event Processor specific options, their respective sections should be checked.
The remainder of this page will cover the generic configuration options for each Event Processor.

=== Event processor builders

The `EventProcessingConfigurer` provides access to a lot of configurable components for Event Processors.
Sometimes it is easier or preferable to provide an entire function to construct an Event Processor, however.
To that end, we can configure a custom `EventProcessorBuilder`:

[source,java]
----
@FunctionalInterface
interface EventProcessorBuilder {

    // Note: the `EventHandlerInvoker` is the component which holds the event handling functions.
    EventProcessor build(String name,
                         Configuration configuration,
                         EventHandlerInvoker eventHandlerInvoker);
}
----

The `EventProcessorBuilder` functional interface provides the event processor's name, the `Configuration` and the `EventHandlerInvoker`, and requires returning an `EventProcessor` instance.
Note that any Axon component that an Event Processor requires (for example, an `EventStore`) is retrievable from the `Configuration`.

The `EventProcessingConfigurer` provides two methods to configure an `EventProcessorBuilder`:

. `registerEventProcessorFactory(EventProcessorBuilder)`: allows you to define a default factory method that creates event processors for which no explicit factories are defined
. `registerEventProcessor(String, EventProcessorBuilder)`: defines the factory method to use to create a processor with given `name`

=== Event handler interceptors

Since the Event Processor is the invoker of event handling methods, it is a spot to configure xref:messaging-concepts:message-intercepting.adoc[Message Handler Interceptors] too.
Since Event Processors are dedicated to event handling, the `MessageHandlerInterceptor` is required to deal with an `EventMessage`.
Differently put, an xref:messaging-concepts:message-intercepting.adoc#event-handler-interceptors[EventHandlerInterceptor] can be registered to Event Processors.

The `EventProcessingConfigurer` provides two methods to configure `MessageHandlerInterceptor` instances:

* `registerDefaultHandlerInterceptor(BiFunction<Configuration, String, MessageHandlerInterceptor<? super EventMessage<?>>>)`: registers a default `MessageHandlerInterceptor` that will be configured on every Event Processor instance
* `registerHandlerInterceptor(String, Function<Configuration, MessageHandlerInterceptor<? super EventMessage<?>>>)`: registers a `MessageHandlerInterceptor` that will be configured for the Event Processor matching the given `String`

=== Message monitors

Any Event Processor instance provides the means to contain a Message Monitor.
Message Monitors (discussed in more detail xref:monitoring:metrics.adoc[here]) allow for monitoring the flow of messages throughout an Axon application.
For Event Processors, the message monitor deals explicitly with the events flowing through the Event Processor towards the event handling functions.

The `EventProcessingConfigurer` provides two approaches towards configuring a `MessageMonitor`:

* `registerMessageMonitor(String, Function<Configuration, MessageMonitor<Message<?>>>)`: registers the given `MessageMonitor` to the Event Processor matching the given `String`
* `registerMessageMonitorFactory(String, MessageMonitorFactory)`: registers the given `MessageMonitorFactory` to construct a `MessageMonitor` for the Event Processor matching the given `String`

The `MessageMonitorFactory` provides a more fine-grained approach, used throughout the Configuration API, to construct a `MessageMonitor`:

[source,java]
----
@FunctionalInterface
public interface MessageMonitorFactory {
    
    MessageMonitor<Message<?>> create(Configuration configuration, 
                                      Class<?> componentType, 
                                      String componentName);
}
----

We can use the `Configuration` to retrieve the required dependencies to construct the `MessageMonitor`.
The type and name reflect which infrastructure component the factory constructs a monitor for.
Whenever you use the `MessageMonitorFactory` to construct a `MessageMonitor` for an Event Processor, the factory expects the `componentType` to be an `EventProcessor` implementation.
The `componentName`, on the other hand, would resemble the name of the Event Processor.

=== Transaction management

As components that deal with event handling, the Event Processor is a logical place to provide transaction configuration options.
Note that in the majority of the scenarios, the defaults will suffice.
This section simply serves to show these options to allow adjustment if the application requires it.

The first of these is the `TransactionManager`.
Axon uses the `TransactionManager` to attach a transaction to every xref:messaging-concepts:unit-of-work.adoc[Unit of Work].
Within a Spring environment, the `TransactionManager` defaults to a `SpringTransactionManager`, which uses Spring's `PlatformTransactionManager` under the hood.
In non Spring environments, it would be wise to build a `TransactionManager` implement if transaction management is required, of course.
Such an implementation only requires the definition of the `TransactionManager#startTransaction()` method.
To adjust the transaction manager for an Event Processor, the `registerTransactionManager(String, Function<Configuration, TransactionManager>)` on the `EventProcessingConfigurer` should be used.

Secondly, you can adjust the desired `RollbackConfiguration` per Event Processor.
It is the `RollbackConfiguration` that decide when a xref:messaging-concepts:unit-of-work.adoc[Unit of Work] should rollback the transaction.
The default `RollbackConfiguration` is to rollback on any type of `Throwable`; the xref:messaging-concepts:unit-of-work.adoc[Unit of Work] page describes the other options you can choose.
To adjust the default behaviour, the `registerRollbackConfiguration(String, Function<Configuration, RollbackConfiguration>)` function should be invoked on the `EventProcessingConfigurer`.

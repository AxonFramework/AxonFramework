:navtitle: Known Issues and Workarounds

As with any tool, library, or framework, there are well-known issues you might find with Axon Framework.
Since Axon Framework integrates with many other tools, it is challenging to find the perfect solution for every scenario.

This page provides the biggest "gotchas," with optional workarounds.

[NOTE]
.Where is issue XYZ?
====
This page can by no means contain **all** possible issues.
However, we are open for suggestions.

This documentation, just as the framework, is open source.
Hence, if you have found something problematic that you think should be added to the list, be sure to file an issue and (ideally!) a pull request.

You can make an enhancement request by clicking link:https://github.com/AxonFramework/AxonFramework/issues/new?assignees=&labels=Type%3A+Enhancement&projects=&template=2_enhancement_request.md[here].
When looking to provide a pull request, be sure to adjust link:https://github.com/AxonFramework/AxonFramework/blob/master/docs/old-reference-guide/modules/ROOT/pages/serialization.adochttps://github.com/AxonFramework/AxonFramework/blob/master/docs/old-reference-guide/modules/ROOT/pages/known-issues-and-workarounds.adoc[this file].

== PostgreSQL and large object storage

[TIP]
.PostgreSQL Extension
====
You can use Axoniq's PostgreSQL Extension instead of setting up PostgreSQL yourself as a event storage solution. For more information, please check the repository link:https://github.com/AxonIQ/extension-postgresql[here.]
====

When storing the serialized formats of, for example, xref:axon-framework-reference:events:event-processors/streaming.adoc#tracking-tokens[tokens], xref:axon-framework-reference:tuning:event-snapshots.adoc[snapshots], or xref:axon-framework-reference:events:infrastructure.adoc[events], it is good to know Axon uses JPAs `@Lob` annotation for these columns.

This choice combined with link:https://www.postgresql.org/[PostgreSQL] and Hibernate, causes unexpected behavior for most.

PostgreSQL has a feature called link:https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/largeobjects.html["Large Object Storage"], which moves `LOB`, `BLOB`, and `CLOB` columns to a singular large object storage table.
Instead of the `LOB`/`BLOB`/`CLOB` type, the column will be of type `OID` (object identifier).
Hences, the rows will contain this `OID` instead of the data directly.
Hibernate will default `@Lob` annotated fields to go through this Large Object Storage feature, by automatically mapping to the `OID` type.

Hence, in such a setup, all your serialized tokens, sagas, snapshots, and events will automatically move to another table, with all added overhead coming with it.
Using xref:axon-server-reference::index.adoc[Axon Server] will, obviously, resolve this for your events and snapshots, as you would no longer use an RDBMS in that case.
However, even when using Axon Server, the predicament remains for tokens and sagas.

For those cases, it would be wise to adjust the Hibernate mapping.
The most straightforward way, is to enforce the use of the `BYTEA` column type; with some additional steps, of course.
For a full explanation and walkthrough, please check the xref:axon-framework-reference:tuning:rdbms-tuning.adoc#_postgresql_lob_annotated_columns_and_default_hibernate_mapping[PostegreSQL, LOB annotated columns, and default Hibernate mapping] tuning page.

== Sequence generation issues with JPA Entities

For the JPA entities that require a generated sequence, we decided to use the default `@GeneratedValue` annotation back in 2016.
In the pre-Hibernate-6 age, this typically resulted in the construction of a single sequence generator that would be reused by several tables.
This can be regarded as suboptimal, as frequently, the sequence generator would be reused between tables.

Especially given the nature of the `global_index` column on the `domain_event_entry` table, which is used to keep the progress in xref:axon-framework-reference:events:event-processors/streaming.adoc[streaming event processors], a reused generator, causes unexpected gaps in event processing.
Although Axon Framework can deal with these gaps, they make the queries to the `domain_event_entry` table rather bulky.

Just as with any event storage solution, using a dedicated event store implementation like xref:axon-server-reference::index.adoc[Axon Server] will solve the problem entirely.
Instead of using Axon Server, it is also possible to define sequence generators manually for Axon's entities.
The xref:axon-framework-reference:tuning:rdbms-tuning.adoc[Relational Database Tuning page] contains a section on how to do this, called xref:axon-framework-reference:tuning:rdbms-tuning.adoc#auto_increment_and_sequences[Auto-Increment and Sequences].

As described earlier, the `@GeneratedValue` was introduced in 2016.
With the recent move to Hibernate 6, which defaults the increment value to 50, the problem of gaps or unintended reuse between tables has only become bigger.
Especially when combining this with Axon's xref:multitenancy-extension-reference::index.adoc[multitenancy] extension, the new default behavior of Hibernate 6 might cause uniqueness issues in this way.

Hence, given the history on the subject, and the Axon-team having explained this predicament more frequent than they can count, we intend to address the sequence generation behavior in Axon Framework 5.

== Protobuf version conflicts with Axon Server Connector

When using Axon Framework 4.11+ with Axon Server Connector, you might encounter startup failures with this error:

```
java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: com/google/protobuf/RuntimeVersion$RuntimeDomain
```

This occurs due to a version conflict between the `protobuf-java` dependency required by Axon Server Connector (4.29.3 or newer) and other dependencies in your project that might pull in older protobuf versions (such as 3.x).

The Axon Server Connector uses protobuf 4.x features, specifically the `RuntimeVersion` class which doesn't exist in protobuf 3.x. Maven's dependency resolution might select the older version due to its "nearest definition" strategy, causing runtime failures.

[NOTE]
.Maven dependency mediation
====
Maven's dependency mediation using the "nearest definition" strategy often favors dependencies closer to your project root over Axon's deeper dependencies, causing your runtime failure. There might be another dependency in your project—closer to the root that depends on protobuf-java 3.x.

====

To resolve this issue, explicitly override the protobuf version in your project:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.google.protobuf</groupId>
    <artifactId>protobuf-java</artifactId>
    <version>4.33.1</version>
</dependency>
----

According to gRPC-Java maintainers, any protobuf 4.x version above 4.27.4 will work and remain backwards compatible with libraries depending on protobuf 3.x.

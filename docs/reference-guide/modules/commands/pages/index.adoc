= Commands
:page-aliases: README.adoc

Commands are messages that express the intent to change application state.
They represent actions that _should_ happen, such as "create an order," "update a user profile," or "approve a payment."
In Axon Framework, commands are a fundamental building block of your application architecture.

== Command-centric approach

Axon Framework takes a **messaging-centric** approach to application design.
Commands are central to how your application processes user actions and external events.
The framework provides comprehensive support for:

* **Dispatching commands** - Sending commands from controllers, APIs, or other handlers
* **Handling commands** - Processing commands to validate requests and apply changes
* **Routing commands** - Directing commands to the appropriate handler based on routing keys
* **Coordinating changes** - Managing state changes across one or more components

This approach emphasizes _what you want to accomplish_ (commands) rather than _how you structure your domain model_.

== Command handlers: stateful and stateless

Command handlers fall into two main categories based on how they manage state:

**Stateful handlers** (most common)::
Handlers where Axon Framework manages the state lifecycle automatically.
Axon loads the current state, invokes your handler, and persists any changes.
Your handler focuses on business logic while Axon handles state management.
+
Examples: Order handlers, user account handlers, payment handlers

**Stateless handlers**::
Handlers where state is not managed by Axon Framework.
These handlers must query and manage state themselves when needed, typically by calling external services or databases directly within the handler.
+
Examples: Integration handlers that call external APIs, handlers that query read models, notification handlers

=== Managing state with entities

For stateful command handling, Axon Framework provides comprehensive **entity** support for state management.
Entities are components that encapsulate state and the business logic that operates on that state.

Axon supports two approaches to entity state management:

* **Event-sourced entities** - State derived from a sequence of events
* **State-stored entities** - State persisted directly to a database

You can mix and match these approaches based on your needs.
The choice depends on your specific requirements for state management, auditability, and consistency.

Alternatively, you can implement stateful handlers without using entities, managing state through your own custom mechanisms.

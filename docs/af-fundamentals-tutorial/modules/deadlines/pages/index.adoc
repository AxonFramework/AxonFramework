= Deadlines in Axon Framework
:navtitle: Deadlines

== Introduction

Sometimes, you don't want to trigger an aggregate or saga directly, but only after some time has passed.
When this is the case, you can use a Deadline.
Note that if the event you want to publish is a non-domain event, a scheduled event might be a better fit.
To use deadlines, you need a `DeadlineManager`.

This how-to guides you through the basics of starting to work with deadlines.
This includes configuring a deadline manager, scheduling, and handling of a deadline, and writing a test for it.
Finally, changing it to a more advanced use case by expanding the functionality.
As an example it uses an expiring gift card after a certain amount of time has passed.

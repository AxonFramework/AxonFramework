### modules/axon-framework-commands/pages/command-handlers.adoc
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED
**Changes applied:**
- Completely rewrote documentation with Axon 5 concepts and command-centric approach

  - Stateless handlers: Don't maintain state in handler itself (may access state through services)
  - Stateful handlers: Maintain state in handler itself across invocations
  - Emphasized commands should change conceptual state (not just validate)

  - Entity-centric: Command handlers placed directly on entity class
  - Command-centric: Command handlers in separate component, entity passed as parameter (Axon auto-loads)
  - Explained when to use each approach
- **Handler types within stateful handlers:**
  - Creational handlers: Must be static methods (constructors cannot have @CommandHandler in Axon 5)
  - Instance handlers: Instance methods on entity, or methods with entity parameter

  - Updated all examples to use static methods instead of constructors for creational handlers
- **Documented @EntityCreator annotation:**
  - Explained distinction: @CommandHandler creates via commands, @EntityCreator reconstitutes from events

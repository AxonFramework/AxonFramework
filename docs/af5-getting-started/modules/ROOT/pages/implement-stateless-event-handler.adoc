= Feature: Send Notification When Student Subscribed

One of the greatest benefits of using an event-driven architecture is the ability to react to events that occur in your system.
Thanks to that, you can implement features that are decoupled from the core business logic and add new behavior without changing existing parts of the system.

In this example, we will implement a stateless event handler that sends a notification when a student subscribes to a course.

= Connecting to Axon Server

While the in-memory Event Store is perfect for getting started and understanding the concepts, real applications need persistent storage.
This is where Axon Server comes into play!
Axon Server is the purpose-built event store for Axon Framework applications, and with Axon Framework 5, it fully supports the Dynamic Consistency Boundary (DCB) concept that change the wayt you think about event sourcing.

The best part?
Connecting your application to Axon Server is incredibly simple—it's designed to work out of the box with minimal configuration.

== Adding Axon Server dependency

The first step is to add the Axon Server connector dependency to your `pom.xml`.
This single dependency provides everything you need to connect to Axon Server:

[source,xml]
./pom.xml
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.axonframework</groupId>
    <artifactId>axon-server-connector</artifactId>
    <version>${axon.version}</version>
</dependency>
----

That's it for the code changes!
Axon Framework 5 will automatically detect the presence of the Axon Server connector and configure your application to use it instead of the in-memory Event Store.
No additional configuration code is needed—the framework handles all the wiring for you.

== Running Axon Server with Docker

To run Axon Server locally, we'll use Docker Compose.
Create a `docker-compose.yml` file in your project root:

[source,yaml]
./docker-compose.yml
----
version: '3.8'
services:
  axon-server:
    image: axoniq/axonserver:latest-dev
    hostname: axon-server
    ports:
      - "8024:8024"
      - "8124:8124"
    environment:
      - AXONIQ_AXONSERVER_DEVMODE_ENABLED=true
    volumes:
      - axonserver-data:/axonserver/data
      - axonserver-events:/axonserver/events
      - axonserver-config:/axonserver/config

volumes:
  axonserver-data:
  axonserver-events:
  axonserver-config:
----

Start Axon Server by running:

[source,bash]
----
docker compose up
----

This will start Axon Server and make it available at `http://localhost:8024` for the web UI and `localhost:8124` for gRPC connections.

== Creating a DCB-enabled context

Here's where it gets exciting!
To use the Dynamic Consistency Boundary features we've been learning about, you need to create a special DCB-enabled context in Axon Server.

1. Open the Axon Server UI at http://localhost:8024[http://localhost:8024,role=external,window=_blank]
2. Click on "Create new context"
3. Enter `university` as the context name
4. **Crucially**: Check the `DCB context (beta)` checkbox in the General settings tab

[IMPORTANT]
====
The DCB context checkbox is essential!
If you forget to create the context or miss the DCB checkbox, your application will fail with an error like:

[,console]
----
org.axonframework.commandhandling.CommandExecutionException: Exception while handling command
Caused by: java.util.concurrent.ExecutionException: io.grpc.StatusRuntimeException: UNAVAILABLE
----
====

== Testing with Axon Server

One of the great benefits of Axon Framework's design (thanks to the new configuration approach and the test fixtures) is that your tests work seamlessly with both the in-memory Event Store and Axon Server.
When you run your `AxonTestFixture` tests with the Axon Server connector dependency present, the fixture will automatically use your Axon Server configuration.
This means your tests now run against the same Event Store technology as production.

Your existing test code doesn't need any changes:

[source,java]
----
@BeforeEach
void beforeEach() {
    var application = new UniversityAxonApplication();
    fixture = AxonTestFixture.with(application.configurer()); // <1>
}
----
<1> The fixture automatically detects and uses Axon Server when the connector is present

== Switching between Event Store implementations

Sometimes you might want to switch back to the in-memory Event Store for development or testing purposes.
To do that, you may use configuration properties as shown in the link:https://github.com/AxonIQ/university-demo/[Axon University Demo repository on GitHub,role=external,window=_blank].

This flexibility allows you to:
* Use in-memory storage for fast unit tests
* Use Axon Server for integration tests and production
* Switch between implementations without code changes

== What's next?

With Axon Server configured, your events are now persisted reliably, and you can take advantage of all the advanced features that Axon Server provides.
To read more about that, visit the link:https://docs.axoniq.io/axon-server-reference/v2025.1/[Axon Server Reference,role=external,window=_blank].

Your application is now ready for more complex scenarios and can handle the full power of event sourcing with persistent storage.
In production environments, you'd typically run Axon Server in a cluster configuration for high availability, but this single-node setup is perfect for development and learning.

The beauty of Axon Framework's approach is that your code remains completely unchanged—whether you're using in-memory storage or Axon Server, your command handlers, event sourcing handlers, and business logic work exactly the same way.

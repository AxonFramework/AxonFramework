= Feature: Send Notification To The Administrator When All Courses Are Fully Booked

In this example, we will implement a stateful event handler that monitors course availability and sends a notification to the administrator when all courses become fully booked.
This enables administrators to take immediate action such as opening additional course sections, adjusting capacity, or coordinating with other faculties to meet student demand.

== What is a stateful event handler?

A stateful event handler is a component that reacts to events while maintaining internal state between event processing.
Unlike stateless handlers that simply perform actions in response to single events, stateful handlers accumulate information from multiple events to make decisions.

Common use cases for stateful event handlers include:
- Building read models and projections, like dashboards or reprorting views
- Triggering actions when conditions are met across time, like in Saga or Process Manager

== Understanding the administrator notification feature

image::EventModeling_WhenAllCoursesFullyBookedThenSendNotification.jpg[]

The diagram shows an Event Modeling flow with an **Automation pattern**. The gear symbol (⚙️) represents an automated process that monitors the system state and triggers actions when conditions are met. In Event Modeling terminology, this automation works like a "todo list that a process goes and does and marks items as done" - it continuously evaluates whether all courses are fully booked and sends notifications when needed.
The stateful handler implements this automation pattern by monitoring multiple events to determine when all courses are fully booked, then triggering the notification to the administrator.

This is a perfect example of a stateful operation because:

1. **State tracking required** - We need to monitor capacity and enrollment across all courses
2. **Multiple event types** - We react to course creation, capacity changes, and student subscriptions
3. **Conditional logic** - Notification is sent only when all courses are fully booked

== Setting up the stateful event handler

We'll build upon the notification infrastructure from the previous tutorial, so make sure you have the `NotificationService` configured.

=== Step 1: Define the command and event

First, let's define the command that will be sent internally and the event that tracks notification status:

[source,java]
.src/main/java/io/axoniq/demo/university/faculty/automation/allcoursesfullybookednotifier/SendAllCoursesFullyBookedNotification.java
----
public record SendAllCoursesFullyBookedNotification(String facultyId) { // <1>
}
----

<1> Simple command to trigger the notification sending - contains faculty ID for targeting

[source,java]
.src/main/java/io/axoniq/demo/university/faculty/events/AllCoursesFullyBookedNotificationSent.java
----
public record AllCoursesFullyBookedNotificationSent( // <1>
        @EventTag(key = FacultyTags.FACULTY_ID) // <2>
        String facultyId
) {
}
----

<1> Event indicating that the notification has been sent
<2> Tagged with faculty ID for proper event stream organization

=== Step 2: Implement the stateful event handler

Now let's create the main stateful event handler with its internal state management:

[source,java]
.src/main/java/io/axoniq/demo/university/faculty/automation/allcoursesfullybookednotifier/WhenAllCoursesFullyBookedThenSendNotification.java
----
public class WhenAllCoursesFullyBookedThenSendNotification {

    private static final String FACULTY_ID = "ONLY_FACULTY_ID"; // <1>

    @EventSourcedEntity // <2>
    record State(Map<CourseId, Course> courses, boolean notified) {

        record Course(int capacity, int students) { // <3>

            Course capacity(int newCapacity) {
                return new Course(newCapacity, this.students);
            }

            Course studentSubscribed() {
                return new Course(this.capacity, this.students + 1);
            }

            Course studentUnsubscribed() {
                return new Course(this.capacity, this.students - 1);
            }

            boolean isFullyBooked() { // <4>
                return students >= capacity;
            }
        }

        @EntityCreator // <5>
        State() {
            this(new HashMap<>(), false);
        }

        @EventSourcingHandler // <6>
        State evolve(CourseCreated event) {
            courses.put(event.courseId(), new Course(event.capacity(), 0));
            return new State(courses, notified);
        }

        @EventSourcingHandler
        State evolve(CourseCapacityChanged event) {
            courses.computeIfPresent(event.courseId(), (id, course) -> course.capacity(event.capacity()));
            return new State(courses, notified);
        }

        @EventSourcingHandler
        State evolve(StudentSubscribedToCourse event) {
            courses.computeIfPresent(event.courseId(), (id, course) -> course.studentSubscribed());
            return new State(courses, notified);
        }

        @EventSourcingHandler
        State evolve(StudentUnsubscribedFromCourse event) {
            courses.computeIfPresent(event.courseId(), (id, course) -> course.studentUnsubscribed());
            return new State(courses, notified);
        }

        @EventSourcingHandler
        State evolve(AllCoursesFullyBookedNotificationSent event) { // <7>
            return new State(courses, true);
        }
    }

    // Command and Event handlers will be added in next steps...
}
----

<1> Simplified to use a single faculty ID for this tutorial
<2> Event-sourced entity that maintains state across multiple events
<3> Inner record representing individual course state with capacity and current enrollment
<4> Business logic to determine if a course is fully booked
<5> Default constructor creating empty state
<6> Event sourcing handlers that evolve state based on different event types
<7> Handler to track when notification has already been sent - allows you to track it in your EventStore instead of external systems

=== Step 3: Add command handler for notification

Now let's add the command handler that actually sends the notification:

[source,java]
.src/main/java/io/axoniq/demo/university/faculty/automation/allcoursesfullybookednotifier/WhenAllCoursesFullyBookedThenSendNotification.java (continued)
----
    static class AutomationCommandHandler { // <1>

        @CommandHandler
        public void decide(
                SendAllCoursesFullyBookedNotification command,
                @InjectEntity(idProperty = FacultyTags.FACULTY_ID) State state, // <2>
                ProcessingContext context
        ) {
            var canNotify = state != null && !state.notified(); // <3>
            if (canNotify) {
                var notification = new NotificationService.Notification("admin", "All courses are fully booked now."); // <4>
                context.component(NotificationService.class).sendNotification(notification);
                var eventAppender = EventAppender.forContext(context); // <5>
                eventAppender.append(new AllCoursesFullyBookedNotificationSent(command.facultyId()));
            }
        }
    }
----

<1> Internal command handler class for better organization
<2> Inject the current state to check if we can send notification
<3> Only send if we haven't notified already
<4> Create and send the notification to admin
<5> Record that we've sent the notification by emitting an event

=== Step 4: Add event handlers for state monitoring

Finally, let's add event handlers that monitor course state changes and trigger notifications:

[source,java]
.src/main/java/io/axoniq/demo/university/faculty/automation/allcoursesfullybookednotifier/WhenAllCoursesFullyBookedThenSendNotification.java (continued)
----
    static class AutomationEventHandler { // <1>

        CompletableFuture<?> react(
                StudentSubscribedToCourse event, // <2>
                CommandDispatcher commandDispatcher,
                ProcessingContext context
        ) {
            var state = context.component(StateManager.class).loadEntity(State.class, FACULTY_ID, context).join(); // <3>
            return sendNotificationIfAllCoursesFullyBooked(state, commandDispatcher);
        }

        @EventHandler
        CompletableFuture<?> react(
                CourseCapacityChanged event, // <4>
                CommandDispatcher commandDispatcher,
                ProcessingContext context
        ) {
            var state = context.component(StateManager.class).loadEntity(State.class, FACULTY_ID, context).join();
            return sendNotificationIfAllCoursesFullyBooked(state, commandDispatcher);
        }

        private CompletableFuture<?> sendNotificationIfAllCoursesFullyBooked( // <5>
                State state,
                CommandDispatcher commandDispatcher
        ) {
            var automationState = state != null ? state : new State();
            var allCoursesFullyBooked = automationState.courses.values().stream().allMatch(State.Course::isFullyBooked); // <6>
            var shouldNotify = allCoursesFullyBooked &amp;&amp; !automationState.notified();  // <7>
            if (!shouldNotify) {
                return CompletableFuture.completedFuture(null);
            }
            return commandDispatcher.send(new SendAllCoursesFullyBookedNotification(FACULTY_ID), Object.class); // <8>
        }

    }
----

<1> Event handler class that monitors relevant events
<2> React to student subscriptions - might trigger notification if this makes all courses full
<3> Load current state to evaluate condition
<4> React to capacity changes - might affect whether all courses are full
<5> Common logic to check condition and send command if needed
<6> Business rule: all courses must be fully booked
<7> Only notify if condition is met AND we haven't notified before
<8> Send command to trigger notification (which goes to command handler above). The `CommandDispatcher` allows to execute the command within the current `ProcessingContext`.

=== Step 5: Configuration

Now we need to configure all the components - the event-sourced entity, command handler, and event processor:

[source,java]
.src/main/java/io/axoniq/demo/university/faculty/automation/allcoursesfullybookednotifier/AllCoursesFullyBookedNotifierConfiguration.java
----
public class AllCoursesFullyBookedNotifierConfiguration {

    public static EventSourcingConfigurer configure(EventSourcingConfigurer configurer) {
        EntityModule<String, WhenAllCoursesFullyBookedThenSendNotification.State> automationState = // <1>
                EventSourcedEntityModule.autodetected(String.class, WhenAllCoursesFullyBookedThenSendNotification.State.class);

        PooledStreamingEventProcessorModule automationProcessor = EventProcessorModule // <2>
                .pooledStreaming("Automation_WhenAllCoursesFullyBookedThenSendNotification_Processor")
                .eventHandlingComponents(
                        c -> c.autodetected(cfg -> new WhenAllCoursesFullyBookedThenSendNotification.AutomationEventHandler()) // <3>
                )
                .notCustomized();

        var commandHandlingModule = CommandHandlingModule.named("SendAllCoursesFullyBookedCommandHandler") // <4>
                .commandHandlers()
                .annotatedCommandHandlingComponent(cfg -> new WhenAllCoursesFullyBookedThenSendNotification.AutomationCommandHandler()) // <5>
                .build();

        return configurer
                .componentRegistry(cr -> cr.registerModule(automationState)) // <6>
                .registerCommandHandlingModule(commandHandlingModule) // <7>
                .modelling(modelling -> modelling.messaging(messaging -> messaging.eventProcessing(eventProcessing ->
                        eventProcessing.pooledStreaming(ps -> ps.processor(automationProcessor)) // <8>
                )));
    }
}
----

<1> Configure the event-sourced entity module for state management
<2> Configure the event processor for handling incoming events
<3> Register the event handler component
<4> Configure command handling module with descriptive name
<5> Register the command handler component
<6> Register the entity module for state persistence
<7> Register the command handling module
<8> Register the event processor module

== Testing the stateful event handler

Let's create a comprehensive test that verifies the stateful behavior:

[source,java]
.src/test/java/io/axoniq/demo/university/faculty/automation/allcoursesfullybookednotifier/WhenAllCoursesFullyBookedThenSendNotificationTest.java
----
public class WhenAllCoursesFullyBookedThenSendNotificationAxonFixtureTest {

    private AxonTestFixture fixture;

    @BeforeEach
    void beforeEach() {
        var application = new UniversityAxonApplication();
        var sliceConfigurer = application.configurer(configurer -> { // <1>
            configurer = NotificationServiceConfiguration.configure(configurer);
            return AllCoursesFullyBookedNotifierConfiguration.configure(configurer);
        });
        fixture = AxonTestFixture.with(sliceConfigurer);
    }

    @AfterEach
    void afterEach() {
        fixture.stop();
    }

    @Test
    void automationTest() {
        var studentId1 = StudentId.random();
        var studentId2 = StudentId.random();
        var courseId1 = CourseId.random();
        var courseId2 = CourseId.random();

        var expectedNotification = new NotificationService.Notification("admin", "All courses are fully booked now.");

        fixture.given()
                .events( // <2>
                        new CourseCreated(courseId1, "Course 1", 2), // Create course with capacity 2
                        new CourseCreated(courseId2, "Course 2", 2), // Create course with capacity 2
                        new StudentSubscribedToCourse(studentId1, courseId1), // Fill first course
                        new StudentSubscribedToCourse(studentId2, courseId1),
                        new StudentSubscribedToCourse(studentId1, courseId2), // Fill second course
                        new StudentSubscribedToCourse(studentId2, courseId2)  // This should trigger notification
                )
                .then()
                .await(r -> r.expect(cfg -> assertNotificationSent(cfg, expectedNotification)));
    }

    private void assertNotificationSent(Configuration configuration, NotificationService.Notification expectedNotification) {
        var notificationService = (RecordingNotificationService) configuration.getComponent(NotificationService.class);
        assertThat(notificationService.sent()).contains(expectedNotification); // <3>
    }

}
----

<.> Configure both notification service and our stateful handler
<.> Sequence of events that gradually fills all courses to capacity
<.> **Then**: Verify the notification was sent when condition was met

== Key concepts review

=== Stateless vs stateful event handlers

|===
|Aspect |Stateless Event Handler |Stateful Event Handler

|**State Management** |No internal state |Maintains state across events
|**Complexity** |Simple, single-event reactions |Complex, multi-event conditions
|**Use Cases** |Notifications, logging, integrations |Read models, Process Managers / Sagas, complex conditions, monitoring
|**Performance** |Fast, no state loading |Slower due to state management
|**Concurrency** |High parallelism possible |Limited by state consistency needs
|===

== Integration with the main application

To use this feature in your main application, register the configuration:

[source,java]
.src/main/java/io/axoniq/demo/university/UniversityAxonApplication.java
----
public class UniversityAxonApplication {

    public static ApplicationConfigurer configurer() {
        return configurer(c -> {
            // Other configurations...
            NotificationServiceConfiguration.configure(c); // <1>
            AllCoursesFullyBookedNotifierConfiguration.configure(c); // <2>
        });
    }

    // rest omitted for brevity
}
----

<1> Register the notification service infrastructure
<2> Register the stateful automation configuration

== Summary

In this section, you learned how to implement a stateful event handler for complex condition monitoring. Key takeaways:

- **Stateful handlers** maintain state across multiple events to implement complex business logic
- **Event sourcing** provides reliable state management and complete auditability for the automation logic
- **Event Modeling Automation pattern** provides a clear way to visualize and design automated processes that monitor system state and trigger actions

=== Command-based reactions

Notice that in this example, when the automation condition is met, we trigger a **Command** (`SendAllCoursesFullyBookedNotification`) rather than directly calling the notification service. This demonstrates a key principle: stateful event handlers can execute any business logic and interact with other parts of your application through the Event-Driven Architecture.

This approach provides several benefits:
- **Decoupling**: The automation logic is separated from the notification implementation
- **Flexibility**: You can trigger complex business processes, not just simple notifications
- **Consistency**: All business operations flow through the same command handling infrastructure
- **Testability**: Each part can be tested independently

This pattern enables sophisticated automation scenarios: building complex dashboards, and creating intelligent alerting systems.

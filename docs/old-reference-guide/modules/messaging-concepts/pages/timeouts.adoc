= Timeouts

Axon Framework is built around the asynchronous processing of messages.
In order to prevent a message from being processed indefinitely, Axon provides a mechanism to set a timeout on the invocation of a message handler, or on the processing of the `UnitOfWork` as a whole.

== Overview

Both timeouts work with a limit of the execution time (`timeoutMs`), and a time from which warnings will be logged (`warningThreshold`).
When having a long-running handler or transaction, the following will happen:

. After the `warningThreshold` has passed, a warning will be logged.
. For each `warningInterval` that passes after the `warningThreshold`, another warning will be logged.
. When the `timeoutMs` has passed, the handler or transaction will be interrupted.

Both warnings and timeouts are logged at the `WARN` level.
The message will contain:

. The name of the handler with the message, or component of transaction
. The time it has been processing so far
. The time it has left before the timeout is reached
. The stack trace of the handler or transaction, starting from where the timeout started

For example, a warning message could look like this:

This is beneficial for debugging and monitoring purposes, as it allows you to see which handlers are taking a long time to process.
Additionally, it helps prevent a broken process from blocking processing of other messages.
Examples of this are http libraries awaiting a response, that never comes during an event handler.

=== Defaults and disabling

As timeouts and warnings have been introduced in a minor version (4.11), the default values have been set to a high value to not interfere with any processes that users have already built.

Long-running handlers or transactions will start logging warnings after 10 seconds, and will be interrupted after 30 seconds.
You can always change these settings to your liking, or disable the warnings completely as below.
Note that this also disables the annotation-based timeouts.

======
Spring Boot::
+
--
For Spring Boot, disabling all timeouts and warnings can be done by setting the following property in your `application.properties` or `application.yml`:

[source,properties]
----
axon.timeout.enabled=false

Axon Configuration::
+
--
To disable timeouts and warnings for non-Spring Boot applications, you only have to not register the configuration outlined on this page, as it's not activated by default.

[#handler-timeouts]
== Handler timeouts

The method you define for Axon Framework to invoke is known as a message handler.
These are the methods you annotate with `@CommandHandler`, `@EventHandler`, `@QueryHandler`, or `@DeadlineHandler`.

You can set a timeout on all message handlers, with unique configuration per message type.

[tabs]
======
Spring Boot::
+
--
For Spring Boot, the defaults for all message handlers are set to a timeout of 30 seconds.
In addition, by default, they will start warning every second after 10 seconds have passed.
You can tweak these settings by setting the following properties in your `application.properties` or `application.yml`:

[source,properties]
----
# For @EventHandler methods
axon.timeout.handler.events.timeout-ms=20000
axon.timeout.handler.events.warning-threshold-ms=5000
axon.timeout.handler.events.warning-interval-ms=1000

# For @CommandHandler methods
axon.timeout.handler.commands.timeout-ms=20000
axon.timeout.handler.commands.warning-threshold-ms=5000
axon.timeout.handler.commands.warning-interval-ms=1000

# For @QueryHandler methods
axon.timeout.handler.queries.timeout-ms=20000
axon.timeout.handler.queries.warning-threshold-ms=5000
axon.timeout.handler.queries.warning-interval-ms=1000

# For @DeadlineHandler methods
axon.timeout.handler.deadlines.timeout-ms=20000
axon.timeout.handler.deadlines.warning-threshold-ms=5000
axon.timeout.handler.deadlines.warning-interval-ms=1000

Axon Configuration::
+
--
You can create a `ConfigurerModule` with the exact settings you would like.
Without Spring Boot, no default timeouts are applied.

[source,java]
----
public class MyTimeoutConfigurerModule implements ConfigurerModule {

    @Override
    public void configureModule(@NotNull Configurer configurer) {
        HandlerTimeoutConfiguration config = new HandlerTimeoutConfiguration();
        config.getEvents().setTimeoutMs(30000);
        // Set any timeouts and warning thresholds you would like here
        configurer.registerHandlerEnhancerDefinition(c -> new HandlerTimeoutHandlerEnhancerDefinition(config));
    }
}
----
--
======

In addition, you can place a `@MessageHandlerTimeout` annotation on a message handler to override the default timeout. This allows you to have a specific timeout for a message handler that that you know should be faster or slower than the global configuration.

[source,java]
----
class MyEventProcessor {
    @EventHandler
    @MessageHandlerTimeout(timeoutMs = 10000, warningThresholdMs = 5000, warningIntervalMs = 1000)
    public void handle(Object event)
    {
        Thread.sleep(19000);
    }
}
----

Setting `timeoutMs` on the global configuration and the annotation to `-1` will disable the timeout for that specific message handler.
Similarly, setting `warningThresholdMs` to `-1` on both will disable the warning messages for that message handler.

[#unit-of-work-timeouts]
== Unit of work timeouts

The xref:unit-of-work.adoc[unit of work] is the context in which one or more messages are processed.
While xref:#handler-timeouts[handler timeouts] only set timeouts for the invocation if the handler functions, the `UnitOfWork` timeout sets a timeout for the entire processing of the message.
This includes the loading of resources (such as the aggregate of the command), the invocation of the handler function, and the committing of the `UnitOfWork`.

You can customize this for each component separately, such as the `CommandBus`, `QueryBus`, and `EventProcessor`.

For Spring Boot, the defaults for all unit of works are set to of 60 seconds.
In addition, by default, they will start warning every second after 10 seconds have passed.
You can tweak these settings by setting the following properties in your `application.properties` or `application.yml`:

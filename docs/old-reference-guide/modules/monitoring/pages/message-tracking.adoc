= Message Tracking

Tracking messages in your system can be useful to analyze what the cause of a message was.
There are several ways to track messages in your system.
You can correlate messages to each other with a Correlation Data Provider
or log the messages being handled and dispatched.

== Correlation data

The framework provides the `CorrelationDataProvider`, as described xref:messaging-concepts:message-correlation.adoc[here].
This interface and its implementations provide you the means to populate the meta-data of a message based on the message
that is currently being handled.
For instance, you could use this to store the command that triggered the event in the metadata of the event itself,
allowing you to track the cause of it.

Axon Framework provides a `MessageOriginProvider` provider out of the box,
which adds a `trace-id` and `correlation-id` to all messages.
The `trace-id` is the same over all messages that are triggered because of the same origin,
while `correlation-id` contains the message identifier of the previous message.
We can see the effect of this in the following table.

|===
|Message identifier |Type |`trace-id` |`correlation-id`
| 1 | Command | - | - |
| 2 | Event | 8231323 | 1 |
| 3 | Command | 8231323 | 2 |
| 4 | Event | 8231323 | 3 |
|===

Check out the xref:messaging-concepts:message-correlation.adoc[message correlation page]
to find out more about the `MessageOriginProvider`.

== Interceptor logging

You can also track the flow of messages through your application using logging.
You can leverage xref:messaging-concepts:message-intercepting.adoc[Handler- and DispatchInterceptors] to achieve this.
The `LoggingInterceptor` is provided out-of-the-box solution to log any type of message to SLF4J,
but also provides a simple overridable template to set up your own desired logging format.

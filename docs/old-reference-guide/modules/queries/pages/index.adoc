The third type of Message that an Axon application is associated with is the Query Message, or simply Queries.
These are messages that request information in a certain format. Any application can declare it's able to handle a query message, and provide a response to it.

== Types of queries

There are multiple types of queries that cane be distinguished.

. xref:axon-framework-reference:queries:query-dispatchers.adoc#point-to-point-queries[Point-to-point queries]:
They are routed to a single handler, which is expected to return a single result. This is the most common type of query.
. xref:axon-framework-reference:queries:query-dispatchers.adoc#scatter-gather-queries[Scatter-gather queries]:
These queries are dispatched to all handlers that are capable of handling the query.
The results of all handlers are then aggregated and returned to the client.
. xref:axon-framework-reference:queries:query-dispatchers.adoc#subscription-queries[Subscription queries]: These request an initial result and then continue to receive updates as long as the subscription is active.
. xref:axon-framework-reference:queries:query-dispatchers.adoc#streaming-queries[Streaming queries]: These queries are used to request a stream of results, which are returned as they become available.


You can find more about each type of query in the xref:axon-framework-reference:queries:query-dispatchers.adoc[Query Dispatchers] section.

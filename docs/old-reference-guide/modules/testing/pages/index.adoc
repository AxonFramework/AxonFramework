= Testing
:page-aliases: README.adoc

The Axon Framework provides a complete test module to help test your Axon application.
In Axon Framework 5, the testing approach has been redesigned to use the `AxonTestFixture`, which is based on your `ApplicationConfigurer`.
This ensures your tests use the same configuration as your production application, reducing the risk of configuration mismatches.

The `AxonTestFixture` supports testing all types of message handling components:
* Aggregates/Entities
* Event Handlers (Projections)
* Sagas
* Command Handlers
* Query Handlers

This section of the reference guide covers the capabilities that Axon Framework provides to facilitate testing.

A summary of the various sub-sections is given below.

|Sub-Section |Purpose

|xref:commands-events.adoc[Commands / Events] |Testing commands, events, and aggregates with the AxonTestFixture
|xref:sagas-1.adoc[Sagas] |Testing sagas with the AxonTestFixture
|===

[NOTE]
====
The `AggregateTestFixture` and `SagaTestFixture` from Axon Framework 4 have been replaced by the `AxonTestFixture` in Axon Framework 5.
The new fixture uses your `ApplicationConfigurer` to ensure tests reflect your actual application configuration.

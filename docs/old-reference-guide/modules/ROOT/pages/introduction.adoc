Breaking Changes in Axon Framework 4.7!

Against our normal approach towards minor releases, we sadly had to introduce breaking changes between Axon Framework 4.6 and 4.7.
Our apologies for this.

To help you with your upgrade we have constructed a dedicated page xref:upgrading-to-4-7.adoc[here] that helps you on your path to upgrade to 4.7.
If you find any irregularities concerning your upgrade, be sure to reach out to us!

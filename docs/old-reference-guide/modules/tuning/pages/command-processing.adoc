= Command Processing

This page provides specifics around tuning the command processing within an Axon application.

== Duplicate command handler registration

As described in the xref:messaging-concepts:index.adoc[Messaging Concepts] page, a command is always routed to a single destination. This means that during the xref:axon-framework-commands:configuration.adoc#registering-a-command-handler[registration of a command handler] within a given JVM, a second registration of an identical command handler method should be dealt with in a desirable manner.

How an Axon application reacts to such a duplicate registration is defined by the `DuplicateCommandHandlerResolver`. This resolver is a functional interface ingesting a command name and a registered candidate command handler method; a single command handler method is the return value. By default, the `LoggingDuplicateCommandHandlerResolver` is used, which will log a warning and returns the candidate handler.

To configure the used `DuplicateCommandHandlerResolver` it is suggested to use the `DuplicateCommandHandlerResolution`, as this class gives a handle to all provided implementations. To configure the duplicate resolver to, for example, throw a `DuplicateCommandHandlerSubscriptionException` as a warning, the following approach can be taken:

==== Axon Configuration API

Somewhere in a configuration class:

[source,java]
----
DefaultConfigurer.defaultConfiguration().registerComponent(
    DuplicateCommandHandlerResolution.class,
    config -> DuplicateCommandHandlerResolution.rejectDuplicates()
);

----

=== Spring Boot auto configuration
Somewhere in a configuration class:

[source,java]
----
@Bean
public DuplicateCommandHandlerResolver duplicateCommandHandlerResolver() {
    return DuplicateCommandHandlerResolution.rejectDuplicates();
}
----

:reftext: Implementing the create new course feature

= Implement feature: `CreateCourse` -> `CourseCreated`

Axon Framework jest zaprojektowany wokół Messages.
To je traktujemy jako first-class citizen i to one są obserwowalnym zachowaniem.
Nie musisz na początek martwić się o strukturę bazy danych, rysować wielkich diagramów i craftować modeli.
Większość pracy wykonaliśmy już w czasie Event Modelingu, teraz przełożymy to tylko na działający kod!

Let's start by implementing the "Create Course" feature, which allows faculty staff to create new courses with a specified name and capacity.
For that you need to create a Java package that fits in the project architecture, for this example we use *Vertical Slice Architecture* approach, but framework is flexible enough to allow you to use any architecture you prefer.

== Define Messages

First, let's define the necessary messages that will be used for this feature.
In Axon Framework 5, we typically define commands and events as simple data structures - using Java `records`.

==== Command: CreateCourse

Create a new CreateCourse command in the `io.axoniq.demo.university.faculty.write.createcourse` package:

[source,java]
----
package io.axoniq.demo.university.faculty.write.createcourse;

import io.axoniq.demo.university.faculty.write.CourseId;
import org.axonframework.modelling.command.annotation.TargetEntityId;

public record CreateCourse(
    @TargetEntityId CourseId courseId,
    String name,
    int capacity
) {}
----

The `@TargetEntityId` annotation on the courseId field tells Axon which field contains the identifier for the target entity.
In this domain we have two business entities: `Course` and `Student`.

==== Event: CourseCreated

The result of the successful processing of the `CreateCourse` command will be the creation of a new course.
So let's define the `CourseCreated` event in the `io.axoniq.demo.university.faculty.events` package:

[source,java]
----
package io.axoniq.demo.university.faculty.events;

import io.axoniq.demo.university.faculty.FacultyTags;
import org.axonframework.eventsourcing.annotations.EventTag;

public record CourseCreated(
    @EventTag(key = FacultyTags.COURSE_ID) String courseId,
    String name,
    int capacity
) {}
----

The `@EventTag` annotation allows Axon to tag the event as connected with the 'Course' business entity and then use it for efficiently retrieval of the events related to given 'Course'.

=== Define Identifier Type

Let's create a `CourseId` value object in the `io.axoniq.demo.university.faculty.write` package.
This class provides type safety and domain semantics for course identifiers.
Thanks to that you won't mix CourseId with other identifiers in the system like StudentId.
We use them in commands, but for events we prefer to avoid Value Objects, because events need to be deserialized regardless of the current rules for Value Objects creations.

[source,java]
----
package io.axoniq.demo.university.faculty.write;

import java.util.UUID;

public record CourseId(String raw) {
    private final static String ENTITY_TYPE = "Course";

    public CourseId {
        if (raw == null || raw.isBlank()) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Course ID cannot be null or empty");
        }
        raw = withType(raw);
    }

    public static CourseId of(String raw) {
        return new CourseId(raw);
    }

    public static CourseId random() {
        return new CourseId(UUID.randomUUID().toString());
    }

    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return raw;
    }

    private static String withType(String id) {
        return id.startsWith(ENTITY_TYPE + ":") ? id : ENTITY_TYPE + ":" + id;
    }
}
----

// = Implement Create New Course feture
//
// In this step of the tutorial, we will implement the support for our first feature: create a new course in our system.
//
// == Design considerations
//
// Before jumping over the keyboard to start writing code, let's first introduce the big picture of the design of our system so that we are prepared to split and scale it out later.
//
// Although we will work on our rental module, we want to follow *vertical slice architecture* and make our features (slices if you like Event Modeling nomencalture)
// decoupled from each other. We start with feature which are part of the Command Model.
//
// ** *Command Model*: These are the components that receive all the requests that, as a result of processing them, imply a change in the state of our system.
// Requests like "Register a new bike", "Rent a bike" or "Return a bike" are a few examples of Commands
//
// == Implementing the process to register a new bike in the system
//
// :needs-improvement: Add a reference to the types of messages and what a command message is.
//
// When the application receives a request to create a course, that implies that the state of our application will change because, after successfully processing it, we will have a new bike in our system (so, the list of available bikes -our application's state- will have changed).
// So, we will model our request as a `Command`; in our case, we will call it `CreateCourse`.
//
// So, the `CreateCourse` command will be routed to the `Command Model`, where we will implement a handler method to process it.
// That method must create the new `Course` in our system and notify that "a new course has been created" to other components interested in this change.
//
// The type of this message, a *notification that something has happened*, corresponds to what we define as an `Event`.
// Thus, the command handler will trigger a `CourseCreated`.
//
// One last but important thing to remember in our design is the order in which we will implement the code that creates the new course in our system and the code that fires the event that notifies the change.
//
// anchor:design-command-handler[]In our application, we want to follow the design goals of Event Sourcing, and that implies that the changes in our command model will be done as a result of processing the same `CourseCreated` just as any other component in our application will do.
// That means that, among other good reasons, the list of Events will become our system's *single source of truth*.
//
// :needs-improvement: Add a reference to a section with a more in depth review of what Event Sourcing implies and what are the benefits of Event Sourcing.
//
// First of all, let's specify our application behaviour for this feature using Axon Test Fixture.
//
//
// The steps for implementing the command handling for the `CreateCourse` command will be:
//
// 1. Receive and validate the command in the `@CommandHandler`.
// 2. If valid, send a `BikeRegisteredEvent` from the `@CommandHandler`.
// 3. Register and receive the `BikeRegisteredEvent` using an `@EventSourcingHandler` in our Command model.
// 4. Create the bike and assign the details for the bike created in the `@EventSourcingHandler` of our command model.
//
// In the following sections, let's see how to implement each of these steps in detail.
//
// === Defining the command
//
// As we aim to keep the modules loosely coupled so that we can easily split the modular monolith into different projects if we reach in the future the point in which the application has grown too complex that it needs to scale to multiple simpler modules, it's a good idea to keep the definition of the messages that we are going to use to communicate those logical modules in the `core-api` module we created earlier.
//
// So, we will create a new `CreateBikeCommand` in the `core-api` module.
// Create a new package `io.axoniq.demo.bikerental.coreapi.rental` and, inside that package, create the following `RegisterBikeCommand`:
//
// [source,java]
// .core-api/src/main/java/io/axoniq/demo/bikerental/coreapi/retnal/RegisterBikeCommand.java
// ----
// include::example$core-api/src/main/java/io/axoniq/demo/bikerental/coreapi/rental/RegisterBikeCommand.java[]
// ----
//
// <1> The `@TargetAggregateIdentifier` indicates to AxonFramework to use the `bikeId` attribute as the unique identifier to load the Bike with id `{bikeId}` before handling the command.
//
// We have defined the command as a Java record that contains the minimum amount of information necessary to process the command.
//
// TIP: Using a Java record structure also brings the benefit of immutability to our command.
// You can also use a data class in Kotlin to define the commands.
//
// == Implementing the command model
// :needs-improvement: "Add a link to an explanation of what an Aggregate is and how it links with DDD".
//
// The next step to process the `RegisterBikeCommand` is to define the component responsible for processing that request.
// In our example, we are following the DDD design model, which relies on the concept of the *Aggregate* to model the state of our system.
// And, with the Axon Framework, we will use the Aggregate to "designate" (via annotations) the methods the framework should invoke upon receiving a specific message.
//
// === Creating the aggregate class (the Bike)
//
// Thus, we will start by creating the Aggregate (or Entity) that will represent the state of our application related to the feature of processing requests to register, rent or return a bike.
//
// NOTE: In more complex systems, there are some techniques to design your command and query models based on a previous analysis of the interactions and features that the system will support. *Event Storming* and *Event Modeling* are valuable techniques to analyze your system and extract the different Commands, Events, Queries and Aggregates.
//
// :needs-improvement: "Add links to blog posts from the developer portal once they are moved to the new location in the axoniq.io corporate site."
//
// We can start by creating a `Bike` class to model our Aggregate.
//
// [source,java]
// .rental/src/main/java/io/axoniq/demo/bikerental/rental/command/Bike.java
// ----
// @Aggregate <.>
// include::example$rental/src/main/java/io/axoniq/demo/bikerental/rental/command/Bike.java[tags=BikeAggregateClass;BikeAggregateFields;!*]
// ----
//
// <.> We will mark the class with `org.axonframework.spring.stereotype.Aggregate` annotation.
// This way Axon Framework will handle the lifecycle of the instances of our Bikes based on the Commands and Events received by our command model component.
// <.> We will design the attribute that will hold the unique identifier of our bike instance using the `org.axonframework.modeling.command.AggregateIdentifier` annotation.
// <.> We also need a default Java constructor that Axon Framework needs to create the new instance of a bike before populating its fields with the state and invoking the method to handle the Command or Event received.
//
// === Defining the command handler method.
//
// To process a `RegisterBikeCommand` in our application, we must define a method in our `Bike` class that receives the command as an argument.
// To indicate that the method should be invoked upon receiving a command, we will add the `@CommandHandler` annotation provided by AxonFramework.
//
// In this case, as the `RegisterBikeCommand` is the request to create a new instance of a Bike, we must define the command handler using a constructor.
//
// [source,java]
// ----
// @Aggregate
// include::example$rental/src/main/java/io/axoniq/demo/bikerental/rental/command/Bike.java[tags=BikeAggregateClass;RegisterBikeCommandHandler;!*]
//
// ----
//
// <.> The `org.axonframework.commandhandling.CommandHandler` annotation instructs Axon Framework to call this method upon receiving commands.
// <.> The type of the argument indicates to Axon Framework which type of commands should be linked to the invocation of this method.
// <.> The static method `AggregateLifecycle.apply()` is invoked to send the Event that notifies the change in the state of our system.
// In this case, to notify that the *bike has been registered*.
//
// [NOTE]
// ====
// In the command handler, we have not changed the internal properties of the `Bike` instance.
//
// As a general rule and as we discussed in the xref:design-command-handler[Command Handler design considerations], we will simply:
//
// 1. Validate, if necessary, that the command we received is valid and can be processed.
// 2. Send a message notifying that, as the command is valid, the bike was registered.
//
// We will leave the task of setting the properties of our newly registered `Bike` instance for a later step, when the command model reacts to the reception of the `BikeRegisteredEvent`.
// ====
//
// === Handling the BikeRegisteredEvent in the aggregate
// :needs-improvement: A more in deepth reference to Event-Sourcing and ES benefits is required here.
//
// We want to design our system following the principles of *Event Sourcing*, which implies we will use the set of Events as the *single source of truth* for building or refreshing the state of any component in our system.
//
// That means that we will also use the `BikeRegisteredEvent` as the source to trigger the state change in our command model, or, more specifically, in this case, in our `Bike` aggregate.
//
// To be able to react to the event in our `Bike` aggregate, we need to add a method that receives the `BikeRegisteredEvent` event as an argument and annotate that method with `@EventSourcingHandler`:
//
// [source,java]
// .rental/src/main/java/io/axoniq/demo/bikerental/rental/command/Bike.java
// ----
// @Aggregate
// include::example$rental/src/main/java/io/axoniq/demo/bikerental/rental/command/Bike.java[tags=BikeAggregateClass;BikeRegisteredEventSourcingHandler;!*]
// ----
//
// <.> The `EventSourcingHandler` annotation indicates to Axon Framework to link this method to the reception of an event.
// <.> Axon Framework will use the type of the argument to link this method to the specific type of event.
//
// In the implementation of the method, we will finally set the bike properties (the state of our model) with the information provided by the event.
//
// NOTE: The `EventSourcingHandler` will be called right after the event publication by the `CommandHandler`.
// But it also will be invoked in the future, for the same event, when the system receives another command for the same `bikeId` (identified because the command has the same  `@AggregateIdentifier`) and Axon Framework needs to regenerate the current state of the `Bike` instance, by replaying all previous events with the same `bikeId`.
//
// CAUTION: In the `EventSourcingHandler` method, we should never validate or ignore the changes represented by the event received.
// The reception of the event and the invocation of the method imply that the command has already been processed previously.
// So we can't ignore or reject those changes *because they already happened*
//
// With this step, we have completed the code to process a Command that represents the request to register a new bike in our system.
//
// == Implementing the HTTP REST controller
//
// In this section, we will implement the UI layer for our system.
// The UI layer represents the interface our system offers to the outside world to interact with our application.
//
// In our example, we will start with a REST service interface that offers some endpoints so that a third-party application can invoke our system.
// This REST interface is convenient for our example because we can show you how to accept requests from the user or another system and create and send the corresponding Command internally.
//
// === Create the SpringBoot controller.
//
// For the controller, we are going to create a simple Spring `@RestController,` and we will configure a couple of components provided by AxonFramework:
//
// - *`CommandGateway`*: is the abstraction mechanism provided by AxonFramework to send commands to the handler and removes from the controller any need to know all the specifics about the number and location of command handlers registered in our system or how to reach them.
// - *`QueryGateway`*: is a similar abstraction to the `CommandGateway` provided by Axon Framework, but in this case, it is intended to deliver query requests and wait for the query response.
//
// [NOTE]
// ====
// Although we will only use the `CommandGateway` for now, we are also going to add the `QueryGateway` to our `@RestController` as we will need it later to implement the handling of requests to gather information from our system.
//
// If you prefer to implement your code more progressively, just add the `CommandGateway` as this is the only component we will use now.
// You can add the `QueryGateway` field and its initialization later when implementing the code to handle the first query.
// ====
//
// The abstraction these two components provide helps keep our `@RestController` decoupled from the different query and command handlers in our system.
// Axon Framework will inject the proper implementation to handle the routing and communication patterns required both for queries and commands.
//
// Thus, our controller does not need to keep track of any detail about any of the handlers.
// This property is known as *Location Transparency* and it's one of the features that enable our application to scale out later easily because we can move the command handler implementation to a different module and deploy it in a different machine without the need to touch the code that sends the commands.
//
// We will place our controller in the `io.axoniq.demo.bikerental.rental.ui` package.
// Create a `RentalController` java class with the following contents:
//
// [source,java]
// .rental/src/main/java/io/axoniq/demo/bikerental/rental/ui/RentalController.java
// ----
// include::example$rental/src/main/java/io/axoniq/demo/bikerental/rental/ui/RentalController.java[tags=RentalControllerClassDefinition;BusGateways;ControllerInitialization;!*]
// }
// ----
//
// <.> The `@RestController` SpringBoot annotation indicates that this component will define the REST endpoints.
// <.> The `@RequestMapping` SpringBoot annotation indicates the root path for all the endpoints that this controller handles.
// <.> The `CommandGateway` that we will use to send the commands.
// <.> The `QueryGateway` that we will use later to send query requests and wait for the response.
// <.> We will define a constructor that receives both the `CommandGateway` and `QueryGateway` as an argument.
// Spring will provide the right implementation based on the components defined by Axon Framework.
//
// === Implement the endpoint to register a bike
//
// We must add a method in our controller to handle the HTTP Request to register a new bike.
// In our system, to create a new bike, we require the request to provide the type of the bike and the location where the bike is registered.
//
// For this endpoint, we will consider the following request format:
//
//     POST /bikes?bikeType={bikeType}&location={city}
//
// NOTE: When designing a REST endpoint that registers a new element in our system, it is usual to model the API to use a POST request, which contains the information of the entity to create in the body.
// In this first example, for the sake of simplicity, we will receive the bike details as parameters on the request.
//
// To implement the endpoint that handles these requests, add the following method to the `RentalController`:
//
// [source,java]
// .rental/src/main/java/io/axoniq/demo/bikerental/rental/ui/RentalController.java
// ----
// include::example$rental/src/main/java/io/axoniq/demo/bikerental/rental/ui/RentalController.java[tags=registerBike;!*,indent=0]
// ----
//
// <.> The `@PostMapping` links the execution of this method to the reception of `POST /bike` requests.
// <.> The `bikeType` argument is extracted from the parameter with the same name on the request.
// <.> The `location` argument is filled with the value of the parameter with the same name from the request's URL.
// <.> We must create the `RegisterBikeCommand` that represents the command we will send to the command handler in the command model.
// <.> The command requires a unique ID for the bike.
// As this request represents the creation of the new bike, we have chosen to create a unique ID on the controller.
// <.> We send the command through the `CommandGateway` abstraction provided by Axon Framework.
// <.> The command will be dispatched to the command handler.
// It will return a `CompletableFuture` with the result of executing the command.
//
// NOTE: By default, Axon Framework returns the ID of the bike that has been created.
// If there is any error in delivering the command to a command handler (for example, because there is no command handler registered for `RegisterBikeCommand`s), the CompletableFuture will contain the error.
//
// :needs-improvement: "Add a link to explain the routing pattern and communication semantics of a command, and how AxonFramework returns an error or a successful value depending on the command handler."
//
// == Conclusion
//
// In this section, we have implemented the code necessary to handle requests to register a new bike in our system.
//
// The following image represents the design of what we have implemented.
//
// .Diagram with the flow of messages to register a new bike
// image::image$RegisterBikeCommand.png[A diagram that shows the flow to process a Register bike request: First,we receive a POST HTTP request in the RentalController. Then,the RentalController sends a RegisterBikeCommand through the CommandGateway. The RegisterBikeCommand is delivered to the @CommandHandler method of the Bike Aggregate. The Command Handler validates the command and sends a BikeRegisteredEvent that will be sent to every other external module that is "interested" in this type of event. The @EventSourcingHandler also handles the event in the Bike aggregate,which finally updates the internal state by assigning the values from the command to private fields in the bike aggregate.]

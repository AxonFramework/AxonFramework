:reftext: Creating A New AxonFramework Project

= Create new Axon Framework project with Maven

Let's use Maven and/or your favorite IDE and just create a maven project.

[NOTE]
====
After the creation please make sure to set the following project properties.

[horizontal]
archetypeGroupId:: org.codehaus.mojo.archetypes
archetypeArtifactId:: pom-root
archetypeVersion:: RELEASE
groupId:: io.axoniq.demo.bikerental
artifactId:: bike-rental
version:: 0.0.1-SNAPSHOT

== Project structure

We will design our project follows a *Vertical Slice Architecture* which organizes the codebase around features rather than technical layers.
It plays well with the Event Modeling which we used to design our application.

The architecture screams the capabilities of the system by making explicit:
<.> Commands available to users <.> Events that capture what happened <.> Business rules that govern those actions <.> System automations that connect different parts

The project structure includes:

ðŸ“¦ io.axoniq.demo.university
 â”£ ðŸ“‚ faculty (bounded context)
 â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“‚ events (events shared across slices)
 â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“‚ write (command handling slices)

 â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“‚ read (query slices - FUTURE MILESTONES)
 â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“‚ automation (automation slices - FUTURE MILESTONES)
 â”£ ðŸ“‚ shared
 â”— ðŸ“‚ ...
----

Each slice contains the full implementation of a feature, from command definition to command handling and event publication.
This approach allows different slices to be implemented independently and in parallel.
You may even use different implementation styles / architectures inside certain slices.
You will also see that in this tutorial.

Once that we have our project created with basic packages structure, in the next step, we will learn how implement first feature!

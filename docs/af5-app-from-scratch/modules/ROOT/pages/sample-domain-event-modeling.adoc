== The sample domain (University - Faculty)

In this sample, we are dealing with the University Domain.
The initial examples will be around the Faculty Bounded Context.

In the context there are students and courses, that students can subscribe to.
A student can enroll in the faculty.
The faculty can decide to create a course with assigned capacityâ€”the number of students who can subscribe to a course.
The capacity of the course must be maintained.
After the course has been created, its capacity can be changed.
A student can subscribe to a course and unsubscribe.

== Event Modeling

Before jumping over the keyboard to start writing code, let's first introduce the small design up-front of our system so that we are prepared to split and scale it out later.
We conducted an Event Modeling session to identify the messages that will be used in our system.

After an Event Modeling (which you can see above) session we have identified following events:

* `StudentEnrolledFaculty` - a fact that a student has enrolled faculty
* `CourseCreated` - a fact that a course has been created with assigned capacity
* `CourseCapacityChanged` - a fact that the capacity of the course has changed
* `StudentSubscribed` - a fact that the student has subscribed to the course
* `StudentUnsubscribed` - a fact that the student has unsubscribed from the course

Events are a backbone of our system and contract between slices.

Now, when we get a little familiar with the domain, let's start shaping the structure of our University application.

# Axon Framework 5 Reference Guide Migration Instructions

## Project Overview

This is a gradual migration project to update the Axon Framework reference guide from Axon 4 to Axon 5. The reference guide is located in `docs/reference-guide/` and uses Antora for documentation.

Don't emphasize changes in the documentation. Instead, describe the new status as if it is the status quo. If there are very significant changes compared to Axon 4, you can describe them briefly in a NOTE section.

Axon 5 includes fundamental architectural changes:
- Messaging-centric approach (Commands, Events, and Queries are equally important)
- Shift away from modeling-centric focus of Axon 4
- Aggregates → Entities (entities are now implementation patterns, not core concepts)
- UnitOfWork → ProcessingContext (replaces ThreadLocal-based CurrentUnitOfWork)
- EventBus → EventSink (EventSink is the publishing side; introduce this carefully as EventBus is well-known)
- Serializer → Converter
- Async-native APIs throughout
- Dynamic Consistency Boundary (DCB) for event stores
- TrackingEventProcessor removed, replaced by PooledStreamingEventProcessor
- **Sagas not available in Axon 5.0** - will be reintroduced in different format later
- **Deadlines not available in Axon 5.0** - will be introduced with renewed API later
- Test fixtures completely rewritten

## Key Documents

1. **`axon-5/api-changes/`** - Comprehensive API changes documentation, split into focused per-topic files. Start at [`axon-5/api-changes/index.md`](../axon-5/api-changes/index.md) for the table of contents and load individual files (01–12) for the area you are migrating.
   - **NOTE:** These documents mention legacy components as usable, but the documentation policy is that legacy = not available
2. **`axon-5/`** - Other design documents describing the changes
3. **`docs/changes-to-process.md`** - Master tracking document listing all reference guide files and the changes needed for each

## Workflow

1. Select a section from `changes-to-process.md` to work on
2. Read the corresponding reference guide file in `docs/reference-guide/modules/`
3. Consult `axon-5/api-changes/` (start with `index.md`) and other design docs for API details
4. **IMPORTANT:** Always verify against actual code in the framework before making changes
5. Update the reference guide file with the necessary changes
6. Validate al code examples in the reference guide file using the framework code
7. **CRITICAL:** Mark progress in `changes-to-process.md` as sections are completed
   - Change status from "**Changes to apply:**" to "**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED"
   - Add "**Changes applied:**" section listing all changes made
   - This tracking is MANDATORY - never skip this step

## Important Guidelines

### Terminology
- Use "entity" instead of "aggregate" when discussing modeling patterns
- Aggregates are just one type of entity implementation
- **Commands, Events, and Queries are equally important** - emphasize messaging over modeling
- Entities are implementation patterns/tools, not core framework concepts
- The shift is from modeling-centric (Axon 4) to messaging-centric (Axon 5)
- **EventBus → EventSink**: Be careful here
  - EventBus is a well-known concept to users
  - EventSink is more technical and specifically represents the publishing/sending side
  - Introduce EventSink clearly and explain its relationship to the EventBus concept. Make clear that EventSink could also be used when sending Events to a 3rd-party eventing system.
  - Don't just blindly rename - help users understand the shift

### ProcessingContext Usage
**Critical distinction between dispatching and handling:**

**Dispatching side (EventSink, CommandBus, QueryBus):**
- ProcessingContext is **OPTIONAL**
- Provide it when available (e.g., dispatching from within a handler) to propagate correlation data
- When dispatching from outside a handler (e.g., HTTP endpoint), pass `null` or use method variants without ProcessingContext parameter
- Purpose: Allows correlation data to flow from one message to another

**Handling side (all message handlers):**
- ProcessingContext is **MANDATORY**
- Axon always creates one when processing a message
- Must be injected and passed to all components involved in handling the message
- Enables coordination between components during message processing
- Components can inject ProcessingContext as a handler parameter

### Message Types and Payload Conversion
**Critical conceptual shift from Axon 4:**

**Axon 4 approach:**
- Java class representation was the identity of the message
- Handler declared a specific Java class, message had to match exactly
- Upcasters were needed to convert old message formats to new Java classes

**Axon 5 approach:**
- Messages have a **MessageType** (QualifiedName + version) decoupled from Java class
- Handlers declare the message type they support (directly or indirectly via Java class parameter)
- **Payload is converted to handler's expected type at handling time**
- Different handlers can receive the same message in different Java representations
- Makes many upcasters unnecessary - conversion happens during handling, not deserialization

**Important distinction - MessageType vs identifier:**
- **MessageType**: Identifies what TYPE/STRUCTURE of message it is (e.g., "OrderPlaced v1.0")
  - Describes what structure/content to expect
  - Many messages can share the same MessageType
  - Acts as a type/schema identifier
- **identifier**: Uniquely identifies a SPECIFIC message instance
  - Like a UUID for that particular message occurrence
  - Stays the same even if message is represented in different Java classes
  - Acts as an instance identifier

**Documentation implications:**
- Emphasize that Java class is no longer the message identity
- Explain MessageType (QualifiedName + version) as the true message TYPE identifier
- Clarify that identifier is the instance identifier (not MessageType)
- Show how handlers declare types (via @Event/@Command/@Query annotations or parameter types)
- Demonstrate payload conversion at handling time
- Explain when upcasters are still needed vs when simple conversion suffices

**Handler annotation requirements:**
- When handler parameter is @Event/@Command/@Query annotated: Framework derives MessageType from annotation
- When handler parameter is NOT annotated (JsonNode, Map, String, etc.): **MUST specify messageType attribute**
  - Example: `@EventHandler(messageType = "com.example.OrderPlaced")`
  - This tells Axon which message type the handler should receive

### Exception Handling Philosophy
**Important shift in approach:**

In distributed systems, exceptions often lose value when crossing boundaries:
- Exception details may not be meaningful to receivers
- Different services may not share same exception classes
- Receivers need structured information to make decisions

**Guidance for documentation:**
- **Use result objects for expected failure scenarios:**
  - Validation failures, business rule violations, authorization failures
  - These are not exceptional - they're expected possibilities
  - Result objects can carry structured information about failures
- **Reserve exceptions for truly exceptional circumstances:**
  - Infrastructure failures (database unavailable, network timeout)
  - Programming errors (null pointer, illegal state)
  - Configuration errors
  - Situations where normal processing cannot continue

**Documentation approach:**
- Emphasize results vs exceptions distinction in exception handling sections
- Show result object patterns alongside exception handling
- Guide users toward appropriate error handling strategy for their scenario

### Module Structure
- JPA remains in core framework
- JDBC has moved to external extensions (remove references for now)
- Spring has moved to extensions
- Monitoring and tracing moved to extensions

### Removed Components
**DomainEventMessage:**
- `DomainEventMessage` has been removed in Axon 5
- No longer distinguishes between domain events and regular events
- All events are now `EventMessage`
- Remove references to DomainEventMessage in documentation
- Update examples to use EventMessage only

### Legacy Package = Not Available
**Critical policy for documentation:**
- **Anything moved to "legacy package" is effectively NOT available in Axon 5.0**
- Legacy components will either:
  1. Be reintroduced later in a different format, OR
  2. Be permanently replaced by another mechanism
- Do NOT document legacy package as if it's usable in Axon 5.0
- Do NOT suggest users can use legacy components
- **Important:** the `axon-5/api-changes/` files mention legacy components as available, but for documentation purposes treat them as unavailable
- Focus documentation on alternatives and replacement mechanisms

### Components Not Available in Axon 5.0

#### Sagas - Not Available
**Critical information:**
- Sagas are NOT available in Axon 5.0 (moved to legacy)
- They will be reintroduced in a later version in a different format
- **Alternatives to document:**
  1. **Stateful event handlers** - Event handlers that maintain state across events
  2. **Event handlers with custom state storage** - Store and retrieve state from database/cache
  3. **Scheduled checks** - Regular scheduled checks on state instead of deadline/saga scheduling
- Documentation should guide users through migration from Axon 4 Sagas to these alternatives
- Provide practical examples and patterns for each alternative approach

#### Deadlines - Not Available
**Critical information:**
- Deadlines are NOT available in Axon 5.0
- They will be introduced with a renewed API in later versions
- **Alternatives to document:**
  1. **Scheduled tasks** - Use Spring's `@Scheduled` or similar scheduling mechanisms
  2. **Database-based scheduling** - Store deadline information in database, check periodically
  3. **External scheduling systems** - Quartz, JobRunr, or similar job scheduling frameworks
- Documentation should guide users through alternatives
- Provide practical examples of time-based triggers without deadline framework

### Files to Rename
All aggregate-related files should be renamed to entity equivalents:
- `aggregate.adoc` → `event-sourced-entity.adoc`
- `multi-entity-aggregates.adoc` → `entity-hierarchies.adoc` or `child-entities.adoc`
- etc. (see `changes-to-process.md` for full list)

### Files to Rename
**IMPORTANT: This is an incremental migration. Files are renamed gradually, not all at once.**

When working on a file:
1. **ALWAYS verify xref targets exist** before using them
2. Use the OLD filename in xrefs until the target file is actually renamed
3. When you rename a file, update ALL xrefs pointing to it across the entire reference guide

**Workflow for handling xrefs:**
1. Before writing an xref, check if the target file exists with the new name
2. If the target file doesn't exist yet, use the old filename in the xref
3. Add a comment noting that the xref should be updated when the target is renamed: `// TODO: Update to new-name.adoc when file is renamed`

**Example:**
```adoc
// WRONG - references file that doesn't exist yet:
xref:axon-framework-commands:modeling/event-sourced-entity.adoc[Entity]

// CORRECT - uses current filename:
xref:axon-framework-commands:modeling/aggregate.adoc[Entity]
// TODO: Update to event-sourced-entity.adoc when aggregate.adoc is renamed
```

**When renaming a file:**
1. Rename the physical file
2. Use `Grep` to find ALL xrefs to the old filename across the entire `docs/reference-guide/` directory
3. Update every xref to use the new filename
4. Remove any TODO comments about updating that xref

**To find all xrefs to a file:**
```
grep -r "xref:.*old-filename.adoc" docs/reference-guide/
```

### Files to Remove
- `upgrading-to-4-7.adoc` - Will be replaced with Axon 4 to 5 migration guide separately
- Release notes pages - Will be updated in separate task

### Code Examples

- **Java code samples must be externalized, never inline.** Sample sources live in the Antora
  `examples` directory of the documentation component
  (`docs/<guide>/modules/<module>/examples`) and are pulled into pages through tagged regions:
  ```adoc
  [source,java]
  ----
  include::example$queries/querydispatchers/MyExample.java[tag=my-tag,indent=0]
  ----
  ```
  The `docs/_samples` module compiles all of them as part of the default Maven reactor, so an API
  change that breaks a documented sample breaks the build. Read `docs/_samples/README.md` before
  adding or editing samples - it covers the package-per-page convention, tag naming, multi-fragment
  blocks, and the `role=axon4` / `role=pseudocode` escape hatches for intentionally non-compiling
  code. Verify with:
  ```bash
  ./mvnw -pl docs/_samples test-compile
  python3 docs/_samples/bin/compare-snippets.py <page.adoc> HEAD
  ```
  Every difference `compare-snippets.py` reports must be intentional: keep sample indentation
  matching the rendered block, not the framework's chain-alignment style.
- **Always provide code samples where appropriate** - this was a weak spot in previous documentation
- Show both **Spring configuration** and **plain Java configuration** examples
- Spring examples should use:
  - Spring Boot auto-configuration where applicable
  - `@EventSourced` annotation for entities
  - Bean-based registration for components
- Plain configuration examples should use:
  - `MessagingConfigurer`, `ModellingConfigurer`, or `EventSourcingConfigurer` as appropriate
  - Explicit component registration
  - ComponentBuilder and ComponentDefinition patterns
- Use realistic, complete examples that users can actually use
- Ensure code examples reflect Axon 5 APIs (ProcessingContext, EventAppender, etc.)
- **CRITICAL: Verify all APIs before writing code examples**
  - Check actual method signatures in the framework
  - Verify return types (e.g., `CommandResult` not `CompletableFuture`)
  - Verify parameter types
  - Don't assume APIs work like you expect

### Documentation Approach
- **Be user-centric**: Focus on "how do I accomplish X" rather than "how does X work internally"
- Explain what users need to do to get things done
- Avoid going too deep into implementation details unless necessary for understanding
- Keep the focus on practical usage and configuration
- Internal workings should only be explained when they affect user decisions
- Examples:
  - ✅ "To configure an event processor, use the EventProcessorModule..."
  - ❌ "The event processor internally uses a token store which maintains..."
  - ✅ "When choosing between X and Y, consider..." (when implementation matters for choice)

**Limit architectural justification.** Explain a design decision only to the extent it changes what the reader does
next; do not defend or narrate the design process behind a feature. See "Documentation voice" under Writing Style for
the full rule, the actionability test, and the scoping note about narrowly-scoped edits.

### Verification
**CRITICAL - Always verify before writing code:**
- Do NOT make assumptions about API details - **ALWAYS check the actual framework code**
- API methods may have changed in ways not fully documented
- Example: `commandGateway.send()` returns `CommandResult` (which provides access to CompletableFuture), not CompletableFuture directly
- **Before writing ANY code example:**
  1. Search for the actual class/interface in the framework code
  2. Read the method signatures
  3. Verify return types and parameters
  4. Check for any related classes (like `CommandResult`)
- API changes documentation may not cover everything
- When in doubt, ask for clarification or verification
- **Better to ask than to document incorrect APIs**

## Writing Style

### Style Guide Configuration
The documentation uses Vale for style checking. **Errors will prevent the documentation site from building.**

### Critical Rules (ERROR level - will break build)

#### 1. Acronym Capitalization
Always capitalize acronyms correctly:
- ✅ API, APIs, HTTP, HTTPS, JPA, JSON, JVM, gRPC, AMQP, CDI, BOM, DSL, OSGi, SSH, SSL, TCP, URI, URL, YAML, YML
- ❌ api, http, jpa, json, jvm, grpc, amqp
- Note: "api" is allowed as a suffix in module names (e.g., "core-api")

#### 2. Heading Capitalization
- **H1 headings**: Use title-style capitalization (Chicago style)
  - Example: "Understanding the Event Store"
- **H2-H6 headings**: Use sentence-style capitalization (only first word and proper nouns capitalized)
  - ✅ "Configuring the event store"
  - ❌ "Configuring The Event Store"
  - Exceptions: Proper product names (see list below) remain capitalized

#### 3. Proper Names
Always capitalize these names correctly:
- **Products/Frameworks**: Antora, Datadog, Dropwizard, GitHub, Gradle, JGroups, JUnit, Kafka, Kotlin, Logback, Mockito, OAuth, PostgreSQL, Testcontainers, XStream
- **Axon Products**: Axon Framework, Axon Server, AxonIQ Console, AxonIQ Cloud
- **Operating Systems**: macOS, Windows, Linux
- ❌ github, gradle, postgres, axon framework

#### 4. Axon-Specific Capitalization Exceptions
These terms are exceptions to sentence-case rules in H2-H6 headings:
- Axon Framework, Axon Server, Axon Configuration, Axon Messaging, Axon Test, AxonIQ Console
- Command-Query Responsibility Separation (CQRS)
- Domain-Driven Design (DDD)
- Event Sourcing
- Spring, Spring Boot, Spring Boot Starter
- OpenTelemetry, OpenTracing
- And other product names (see full list in Headings.yml)

### Warnings (won't break build but should avoid)
- Remove annotation comments like TODO, FIXME, XXX, NOTE before committing
- Watch for common misspellings (e.g., "poplar" instead of "popular")
- Avoid overly long sentences (Vale may flag sentences that are too complex - break them into shorter, clearer sentences)

### Em-dash prohibition
**Never use em-dashes (`—`) in documentation.** Em-dashes read as machine-generated and make the text feel less human. Use alternative punctuation instead:
- Replace `—` with a comma, colon, semicolon, or parentheses depending on the context
- ✅ "The processor starts immediately, consuming from the head of the stream."
- ✅ "The processor starts immediately (consuming from the head of the stream)."
- ❌ "The processor starts immediately — consuming from the head of the stream."

### Documentation voice
**Write technical documentation in a plain reference-manual style.** The documentation is an information source, not
an essay: optimize for information density, directness, and scanability, not narrative flow, persuasion, or
explanatory elegance.

**The rule that matters most:** do not explain the reader's reasoning for them - state the information they need and
let them draw their own conclusions. Default to the shortest grammatically complete formulation that conveys the
required technical information; if two formulations say the same thing, use the shorter one. Do not write prose whose
purpose is to guide the reader's thought process ("what this means is...", "so what does this tell us..."). This one
distinction matters more than any list of banned phrases below - a model (or a person) can avoid every phrase on that
list and still produce the same explain-first, fact-second discourse structure it is trying to eliminate.

Applies to every Antora module under `docs/`, including `docs/reference-guide/` and `docs/saga-guide/` (and any
future guide module). The one exception is a page explicitly designated as promotional/persuasive - currently
`why-upgrade.adoc` and `solved-architecture-choices.adoc` - which intentionally uses second-person address and
rhetorical questions to make a pitch. Do not let that voice spread to reference, migration-path, or guide content.

**Sentence style**
- State facts directly, one main claim per sentence, in active voice with concrete subjects and verbs where natural.
- Remove introductory or transitional phrases that carry no information of their own.
- Do not add rhetorical framing around a technical fact, and do not explain why the reader should care unless that is
  itself technically relevant (affects a decision, not just interesting background).

**Paragraph style**
- One technical topic per paragraph: state the fact, then the relevant constraint or consequence, then an example if
  one is needed.
- Do not build a paragraph as an argument (fact -> explanation -> implication -> broader implication -> conclusion).
  Do not add a closing sentence that only restates or interprets what came before.
- Three or more related, independent facts belong in a list or table, not a paragraph.

**Explanations - supporting "Limit architectural justification" above**
- Explain *how* the framework works, not *why the reader should find the design interesting*. Keep rationale to one
  sentence, and only when it has an actionable implication - e.g. "the timeout is a command, not an event, so the
  process can reject a stale one" earns its place; a rationale that only explains a trade-off, with nothing the
  reader would do differently for knowing it, does not.
- Test before keeping a justification: if the paragraph disappeared, would the reader still know what to do? If yes,
  cut it or compress it to a clause. Cut standalone sections whose whole purpose is justifying a design decision (e.g.
  a "why there is no replacement construct" section walking through removed-API reasoning) - if the replacement needs
  explaining, explain the replacement, not the decision that led to it.
- This is a call made when writing or substantively revising a page. It is NOT a license to cut content during a
  narrowly scoped edit ("fix the tone of this paragraph") - a scoped edit changes phrasing only; how much
  justification a page carries is a separate editorial decision, made on purpose, not as a side effect of a style pass.

**Transitions**
State a relationship directly instead of signposting it. The most common tells - not an exhaustive list, and not a
lexical blocklist to route around while keeping the same structure: "which is why", "That means that", "The key thing
to understand is", "This brings us to", "The reason for this is", "It is worth...". If a sentence needs one of these
to make sense, the two sentences it connects usually need to be recombined or reordered, not bridged with a
connective.

**Reader address**
Use "you" only for direct instructions ("You can configure the processor with `ProcessingConfigurer`."), never to
create a conversational or persuasive tone ("If you are already familiar with this, you might wonder...").

**Structure**
Prefer headings, tables, lists, code examples, and `[NOTE]`/`[TIP]`/`[IMPORTANT]`/`[WARNING]` blocks over connective
prose. If three or more related items can be a list or table, make them one.

**Style test**
Before committing a sentence, ask: could it be removed without losing a technical fact, constraint, instruction,
example, or necessary explanation? If yes, remove it. Also remove a sentence whose only purpose is to introduce a
topic the heading already names, tell the reader something is interesting/important/subtle, summarize the preceding
paragraph without adding information, or persuade the reader a design is reasonable.

**The transformation this produces:**

Essayistic:
> Axon Framework 5 takes a different approach to saga handling. Rather than retaining the dedicated Saga abstraction,
> it provides the building blocks required to model the same behavior directly, which gives applications more control
> over how these processes are structured.

Reference:
> Axon Framework 5 has no `Saga` construct. Implement the same coordination with framework building blocks: event
> handlers, deadlines, and (in Axoniq Framework) Workflows.

### Final editorial pass
Generation style and grammatical correctness are two different tasks - do not mix them into a single instruction.
After writing to the voice above, run a separate pass over the result:

1. Remove rhetorical questions and conversational transitions.
2. Remove sentences that comment on the text instead of conveying information ("worth dwelling on", "worth a
   moment", "None of those three properties survives, and none is missed").
3. Split long sentences that carry more than one independent claim.
4. Convert three-or-more-item sequences into a list or table.
5. Check subject-verb agreement, articles, possessives, and verb forms.
6. Check that listed alternatives are joined with an explicit "and"/"or", not a bare comma - "X for a
   `<<workflows,Workflow>>`, for a plain `@EventHandler` Y" is missing its coordinator; it needs "..., or Y for a
   plain `@EventHandler`...".
7. Remove unnecessary hedging - "Axon Framework 5 allows you to replace the Axon Framework 4 `Saga` concept with
   existing core framework building blocks" says less, and less clearly, than "Axon Framework 5 has no `Saga`
   construct."

The pass reduces and corrects; it does not elaborate. Do not add new explanations while doing it, and do not
sacrifice grammatical correctness for brevity - "plain" describes the register, not permission to write clipped or
mechanically-translated-sounding sentences. A short sentence with a grammar error is a worse outcome than the
rhetorical version it replaced, not a better one.

**How to verify:** most of this has no reliable grep - proofread by reading the sentence aloud; if it needs a second
reading to parse, fix it. A rough first-pass grep for step 2 catches the most common leftover tells:
`worth dwelling|worth a moment|worth understanding|worth knowing|which is why|deliberately|Let's explore|Here's a
question|What does this mean|Now if you`. Passing that grep is a smoke test, not the definition of compliance - it
will not catch a passage that avoids every listed phrase while still explaining the reader's reasoning for them.

### ASCII-only text
**All `.adoc` files must contain only ASCII characters.** Never use:
- Curly/smart quotes: `"` `"` `'` `'` — use straight `"` and `'` instead
- Em-dash: `—` — use a comma, colon, or parentheses instead (see above)
- Ellipsis: `…` — use three dots `...` instead
- Any other non-ASCII Unicode character

**LF line endings only** — never use CR (`\r`) or CRLF. Configure your editor to write LF.

## Critical Reminders

### After Completing Any Documentation Update

**YOU MUST:**
1. ✅ Update `docs/changes-to-process.md` to mark the section as completed
2. ✅ Verify all xrefs point to existing files (use old filenames until files are renamed)
3. ✅ Check style guide compliance (heading capitalization, acronyms, product names)

**When renaming a file:**
1. ✅ Use `Grep` to find ALL xrefs to the old filename across entire reference guide
2. ✅ Update every xref to use the new filename
3. ✅ Remove any TODO comments about updating that xref

---

**Note for AI Agent:** When starting a new session, read this file and `docs/changes-to-process.md` to understand the current state of the migration. Ask the user which section they'd like to work on next.

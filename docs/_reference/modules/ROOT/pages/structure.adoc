= Modules

Axon Framework consists of several modules packaged and distributed as JAR files. This approach allows developers to pick and choose the functionality they need.

== Bootstrap modules

Those are the modules that allow bootstrapping and configuring an Axon-based application. The application should include the preferred option as a dependency.

xref:configuration:index.adoc[]::
This module contains all the necessary components to configure an Axon-based application manually. It doesn't depend on any third party frameworks.

xref:springboot-starter:index.adoc[]::
This module provides Spring Boot auto-configuration for the application. It depends on Spring Framework to automatically configure all Axon Framework components.


== Core modules

The core modules provide the essential components and building blocks for any Axon-based application.

xref:messaging:index.adoc[]::
This module provides the elements needed to build proper messaging. That includes message busses and gateways, message lifecycle and scopes, correlation, serialization and deserialization, error handling, retries, etc.

xref:modeling:index.adoc[]::
This module contains the components needed to build proper domain models on the command side. Most notably, it supports modeling essential Command-Handling Component types such as Aggregates and Sagas.

xref:eventsourcing:index.adoc[]::
This module contains the components needed to provide an Event Sourcing implementation of the Command model repository.

NOTE: A typical Axon-based application almost always depends on all core modules. However, there is usually no need to declare them as dependencies explicitly. The preferred bootstrap module provides them as transitive ones.



== Optional modules

xref:spring:index.adoc[]::
This module allows developers to configure Axon Framework components in a Spring Application context. It also provides several implementations specific to Spring Framework, such as an adapter for publishing and retrieving Axon Events on a Spring Messaging Channel.

xref:axon-server-connector:index.adoc[]::
This module provides infrastructure components that connect to Axon Server.

xref:test:index.adoc[]::
This module contains test fixtures that developers can use to test Axon-based components, such as Command Handlers, Aggregates, and Sagas. Typically one doesn't need this module at runtime and only adds it to the classpath for running tests.

xref:disruptor:index.adoc[]::
This module contains a specific CommandBus and Command Handling solution based on the Disruptor paradigm.

xref:metrics:index.adoc[]::
This module provides basic implementations based on Coda Hale to collect the monitoring information.

xref:micrometer:index.adoc[]::
This module provides basic implementations based on Micrometer to collect the monitoring information. It's a dimensional-first metrics collection facade aiming to allow developers to time, count, and gauge their code with a vendor-neutral API.

xref:legacy:index.adoc[]::
This module contains components that enable the migration of older Axon projects to use the latest Axon version.

xref:tracing-open-telemetry:index.adoc[]::
This module contains the components needed to enable tracing with OpenTelemetry.

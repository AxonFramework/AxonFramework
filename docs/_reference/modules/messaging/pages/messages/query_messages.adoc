This document provides information about the design, implementation, and intended usage of query messages in Axon Framework.

== Design considerations

Queries are specific type of messages, used to request information. To distinguish them from other message types, the framework must provide a dedicates objects.

=== Name

=== Response type

== Implementation

In Axon Framework, a query message is an immutable, serializable Java object implementing the `QueryMessage` interface.

With queries the communication is always bidirectional, and the response is an object that implements `QueryResponseMessage`.

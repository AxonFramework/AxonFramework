/**
 * A Functional Interface towards a {@link BiFunction} which ingests both a Configuration and a {@link BlockingQueue} of
 * {@link Runnable}, and outputs an {@link ExecutorService}. Provides a means to allow configuration of the used
 * {@code ExecutorService} in, for example, the {@link org.axonframework.commandhandling.distributed.DistributedCommandBus}, but maintaining the option for the
 * framework to provide a {@code BlockingQueue} which is tailored towards message prioritization when building the
 * executor.
 * <p>
 * Before 5.0.0 this class was specific for the Axon Server configuration, but it has been generalized to allow other
 * configurations to provide their own {@code ExecutorService} implementations as well.
 *
 * @param <C> The type of configuration to use for constructing a {@link ExecutorService}.

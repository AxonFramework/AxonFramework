<!--
Thanks for taking the time to draft up an issue for Axon Framework!
Prior to starting off, please read the following:

## Usage Questions

If you are having difficulty using Axon Framework,
 please consider checking AxonIQ's Library first if it answers your question: https://library.axoniq.io/
 
When the library does not cover the specific question you have, take the following into account:
- GitHub is *not* intended for usages questions, instead:
- Drop a questions on AxonIQ's forum: https://discuss.axoniq.io/
- Or place a new question on StackOverflow, using the `axon` tag.

## Reporting a bug, feature, enhancement, or documentation change

Prior to filing an issue, please verify that it's not already reported by someone else.
After that's done, your issue will typically fall under one of the following options:

1. It's a `bug`
2. It's a `feature` request
3. It's an `enhancement` request
4. It's a `documentation` change

It is recommended that for either of the three you use one of the prepared issue template.
You can find all three of them [here](https://github.com/AxonFramework/issues/new/choose). 

## None of the above fit!

If you have encountered a use case which is not a question, nor a feature request, feel free to draft your scenario below.

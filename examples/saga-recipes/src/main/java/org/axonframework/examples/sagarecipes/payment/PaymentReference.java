 * The caller's own key for a payment, opaque to this context.

 * Whatever the caller puts in here is stored and echoed back on every payment event, and never interpreted. It could
 * be an invoice number, an order identifier or, in this example, a rental identifier; the payment context cannot
 * tell and must not care. The bike rental sample application calls this a {@code paymentReference}.
 * <p>
 * The decision model for preparing and cancelling a payment is keyed by this value rather than by
 * {@link PaymentId}. That makes preparing a payment idempotent by construction, since a second attempt with the same
 * reference finds the payment already there, and it lets a caller cancel a payment using only the key it chose
 * itself.

/**
 * The rental payment process: everything that knows both about renting and about paying.
 * <p>
 * Neither context imports the other, and neither imports this package. Only code here may reach into both, which is
 * what makes this the saga. Its single piece of privileged knowledge is that a rental identifier and a payment
 * reference are the same value, expressed in
 * {@link org.axonframework.examples.sagarecipes.saga.shared.RentalPaymentReference}.
 * <p>
 * The same process is implemented several times over. Exactly one implementation is active at a time, chosen with the
 * {@code saga.recipe} property, because otherwise every one of them would dispatch the same commands. A shared
 * contract test runs the identical scenarios against each, which is what turns "these are interchangeable" from a
 * claim into something the build checks.
 * <p>
 * What every implementation has to get right, whatever state it keeps:
 * <ol>
 *     <li><b>Commands it sends must be idempotent.</b> An event processor delivers at least once, so every command
 *     the process dispatches will sometimes arrive twice. The rental and payment contexts absorb that by appending
 *     nothing when a request or payment has already settled.</li>
 *     <li><b>Progress must not be recorded before the command succeeds.</b> There is no transaction spanning
 *     "dispatch a command" and "write my state". Recording first and dispatching second is the bug that wedges a
 *     process permanently: the dispatch fails, the event is not recorded as handled, it arrives again, and the
 *     recorded progress now makes the process skip the work it never did.</li>
 *     <li><b>The handler must return its {@code CompletableFuture}.</b> That is what makes the processor wait for the
 *     command and treat a failed command as a failure of the event. Dropping the {@code return} turns the whole thing
 *     into fire-and-forget, silently, and it is what removes any need to schedule a retry.</li>
 * </ol>
 * <p>
 * Note what is <em>not</em> in this list. Ending the process is not a rule but a choice, and each recipe makes it
 * differently: delete a row, append a completion event, or simply let a predicate over existing events answer the
 * question, and a framework offering one way of holding state can only offer one answer.

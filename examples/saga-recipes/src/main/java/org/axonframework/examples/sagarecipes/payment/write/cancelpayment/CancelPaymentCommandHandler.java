/**
 * Calls off a payment that nobody has paid yet.
 * <p>
 * This is the deadline replacement. Axon Framework 5 has no {@code DeadlineManager}, so instead of a callback
 * scheduled inside a saga, the timeout is expressed as an ordinary command anyone may send at any time: a scheduled
 * sweep, an operator, a test, or a REST call.
 * <p>
 * Both non-cases are silent successes rather than failures, and that is what makes the timeout safe to arrive late:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>The payment was already paid, refused or called off. Nothing to do, and in particular a cancellation that
 *     loses the race against a confirmation must not undo it.</li>
 *     <li>No payment exists for this reference at all, because preparing it never got that far. The caller wanted
 *     the payment not to be outstanding, and it is not.</li>
 * </ul>

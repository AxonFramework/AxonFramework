/**
 * The rental payment process, taken apart.
 * <p>
 * The other recipes keep the process in one class. This one asks whether it needs to be a thing at all, and answers
 * no: what looked like a saga is a handful of independent reactions, each a vertical slice of its own (an automation
 * slice, in Event Modelling terms) of the form "when this happens, do that".
 * <p>
 * It is also the only recipe documented here rather than on a class, for the same reason: there is no class that
 * describes it. Every other recipe is one class, so its class-level documentation is its package documentation.
 * <p>
 * Each slice is a to-do list. The important observation is how few of them need somewhere to keep it:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>{@link org.axonframework.examples.sagarecipes.saga.verticalslices.whenbikerequestedthenpreparepayment.WhenBikeRequestedThenPreparePayment}
 *     and
 *     {@link org.axonframework.examples.sagarecipes.saga.verticalslices.whenrequestrejectedthencancelpayment.WhenRequestRejectedThenCancelPayment}
 *     are completely stateless. The trigger event carries everything the command needs, so the processor's record of
 *     what it has handled is the to-do list.</li>
 *     <li>{@link org.axonframework.examples.sagarecipes.saga.verticalslices.whencancelrentalpaymentthencancelpayment.WhenCancelRentalPaymentThenCancelPayment}
 *     is stateless for a different reason. It could check whether cancelling is still worthwhile, but the payment
 *     context checks anyway, and that check is the one that holds under a race. Asking twice would only duplicate a
 *     decision that is not this slice's to make.</li>
 *     <li>The three slices triggered by payment events cannot be stateless. A payment event carries only the
 *     reference, and approving or rejecting a request needs the bike and the renter, so each keeps a small lookup of
 *     its own. Slices are independent, so none of them shares another's.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * The transactional profile is the best of any recipe: every slice has exactly one effect. The lookups are reads, not
 * writes, so there is no second thing that could fall out of step with the processor's record of progress, and the
 * ordering rule the other recipes have to observe simply does not apply.
 * <p>
 * <b>Each slice gets an event processor of its own</b>, because a handler is assigned to a processor named after its
 * package unless something says otherwise, and every slice has a package of its own. That default happens to be the
 * right answer here, and it buys something the other recipes cannot have.
 * <p>
 * Each slice handles one event type, so the built-in
 * {@link org.axonframework.messaging.core.sequencing.PropertySequencingPolicy} suffices and no equivalent of
 * {@link org.axonframework.examples.sagarecipes.saga.shared.RentalPaymentSequencingPolicy} is needed.
 * <p>
 * The cost is that nothing orders one slice against another. Two reactions to the same rental can run at once, and
 * whether that is safe is decided downstream rather than here: exactly one of confirmed, rejected or cancelled is
 * ever recorded for a payment, and the rental context guards its own commands and appends under a consistency
 * condition. Both of those would have to hold anyway, since neither context assumes a single reader.
 * <p>
 * What this costs is a whole view of the process. No single file describes the rental payment flow any more; it lives
 * in the arrangement of six slices, and only an event model shows it as one thing. That is a real trade, and whether
 * it is worth making depends on whether the process is something people reason about as a unit.
 * <p>
 * Note that ending does not arise here. There is nothing to end, because there was never anything running: each slice
 * reacts and stops.

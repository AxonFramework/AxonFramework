/**
 * The rental payment process, remembering what it needs in a table of its own.
 * <p>
 * The most familiar of the recipes. Two things happen per step, writing a row and dispatching a
 * command, and getting them to agree is this recipe's whole difficulty.
 * <p>
 * <b>Where the transaction comes from.</b> Nowhere in this class, which is the point. With a
 * {@link org.springframework.transaction.PlatformTransactionManager} present the handler already runs in a
 * transaction, so the write below is an ordinary call needing no {@code @Transactional}, deferral or callback.
 * <p>
 * Row and token commit together here only because this application puts the process state and the JPA token store on
 * one {@code DataSource}, which is this deployment's property rather than the framework's. The guard below is what
 * makes the alternative survivable.
 * <p>
 * <b>Why the write comes first.</b> Purely so it happens on the handler's own thread, where the transaction is bound.
 * Ordering carries no correctness weight here: a failed dispatch rolls the row back with the rest of the unit of work.
 * Deferring the write until after the command succeeded is what forces it out of the transaction and into a callback
 * running on whichever thread completed the command's future, and that is a step no state-storing saga needs to take.
 * <p>
 * The exception is a process that cannot know what to store until the command has answered. A saga keeping the
 * {@code paymentId} that {@code PaymentPreparedEvent} hands back is in exactly that position. This one is not: the
 * payment reference is derived from the rental identifier, so everything worth storing is already in hand before the
 * command is sent.
 * <p>
 * <b>Returning the future is load-bearing.</b> A {@link CommandDispatcher} hands back a future immediately and does
 * not enlist with the unit of work, so returning it is what makes the processor await the command and treat a failed
 * command as a failure of the event. Drop the {@code return} and this silently becomes fire-and-forget: the processor
 * records the event as handled, the command is lost, and the process waits forever. It is also what removes any need
 * to schedule a retry.
 * <p>
 * <b>How it ends.</b> The row is deleted. That is safe here only because the commands this process sends are
 * idempotent: a redelivery after deletion restarts the process, re-dispatches, and the rental context declines to
 * append anything. Without that, a tombstone row would be needed instead.

/**
 * Sets up a payment to be paid.

 * The decision model is keyed by the caller's reference rather than by the payment identifier, and that is the whole
 * idempotency story. A redelivered command sources the payment that already exists for that reference, sees it, and
 * appends nothing. Two commands racing for the same reference cannot both win either, because the Dynamic
 * Consistency Boundary append condition covers exactly the events this decision read.
 * <p>
 * Minting a payment identifier unconditionally would produce a second payment for the same rental on every retry, with
 * nothing in the model to prevent it.

/**
 * The event-sourced process again, recording its facts by appending them directly instead of by sending a command.
 * <p>
 * {@link PaymentProcess} is the other half of the pair. Both read {@link ProcessState}, share this package's events,
 * and produce the same commands in the same order; the only difference is the two lines that write a fact down. The
 * contract test runs against both, which is what turns "these are equivalent" into something the build checks rather
 * than a claim in a comment.
 * <p>
 * <b>What it buys.</b> Half the code, and one dispatch fewer per step.
 * <p>
 * <b>What keeps it correct.</b> Not a transaction: events live in Axon Server and tracking tokens in JPA, and nothing
 * spans the two. {@link ProcessState} is what prevents a second recording of the same fact, because the append
 * condition covers exactly the events that entity sourced. That makes the entity the consistency boundary, which is
 * why the trap below matters.
 * <p>
 * <b>What it costs.</b> An event now appears without a command behind it, which is what Event Modelling asks you not
 * to do: the process's own write stops being a write slice on the model. The append condition is also batch-wide,
 * since everything sourced across the batch is combined into one, so the conflict surface is wider than the
 * per-command condition of the command-translating variant, and a single conflict fails the whole batch.
 * <p>
 * <b>The trap to avoid.</b> Appending is safe here only because {@link InjectEntity} sourced something first. A
 * handler that appends without having sourced anything gets an unconditional append condition and therefore no
 * optimistic concurrency at all, silently.

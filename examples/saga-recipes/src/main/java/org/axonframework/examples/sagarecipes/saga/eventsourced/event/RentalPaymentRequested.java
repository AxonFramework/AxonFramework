/**
 * The process asked for payment.
 * <p>
 * An event about the process itself, not about renting or paying. It exists so the process can remember what it did
 * without a table, and it carries the bike and the renter because no entity in either context is keyed by a rental
 * and could be asked later.
 * <p>
 * That the process records its own facts is what makes this recipe work where the derived-state recipe cannot: it
 * needs nothing from the payment context beyond being told that something happened.
 *
 * @param rentalId the rental being paid for
 * @param bikeId   the bike it concerns
 * @param renter   who is renting
 * @param amount   what was asked for

/**
 * The process finished.
 * <p>
 * This is the Axon Framework 5 equivalent of {@code @EndSaga}, and the difference is instructive: ending is a fact
 * the process records rather than a lifecycle callback the framework performs. Once written, every handler
 * short-circuits on it.
 * <p>
 * It also leaves an audit trail the other recipes cannot produce. A repository row is deleted when the process ends
 * and derived state was never written at all, so neither can answer "how did this rental turn out, and when".
 *
 * @param rentalId the rental whose process finished
 * @param outcome  how it turned out

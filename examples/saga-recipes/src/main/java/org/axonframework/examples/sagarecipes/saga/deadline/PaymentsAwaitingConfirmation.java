/**
 * Gives up on payments nobody paid, which is how a deadline is expressed without a deadline manager.
 * <p>
 * Rather than scheduling a callback into the saga's own future, the timeout becomes a projection plus a schedule: a to-do list of outstanding payments, and something
 * that periodically asks which of them have waited too long.
 * <p>
 * This is deliberately <b>not</b> part of any recipe. It is a projection over payment events that dispatches
 * {@link CancelRentalPayment}, which every recipe handles, so it applies to all of them equally. That also means the
 * timeout scenario belongs in the shared contract rather than being tested against one implementation.
 * <p>
 * <b>The design that makes it safe.</b> Writes come only from events; the schedule only reads. Rows appear when a
 * payment is prepared and disappear when it settles, so the list cannot drift from the event stream, and the sweeper
 * has no state of its own to keep in step with anything. That is precisely the hazard the repository recipe has to
 * work around, avoided by construction rather than by care.
 * <p>
 * <b>Why the work is a separate method.</b> {@code AxonTestFixture} cannot manipulate time, so a timeout driven
 * purely by a schedule would be untestable without sleeping. Taking "now" as an argument makes the interesting part
 * an ordinary method call, and leaves the annotation as one line of glue that is not worth testing.
 *
 * <h2>Where this pattern gets harder</h2>
 * The naive version looks simpler than it is, so the caveats are worth stating rather than discovering:
 * <ul>
 *     <li><b>Every instance sweeps.</b> {@code @Scheduled} fires on every instance, so each cancellation is
 *     dispatched once per instance. Sweeping once needs a scheduler that coordinates across instances.</li>
 *     <li><b>A replay rebuilds the list with the original timestamps.</b> Every historical pending payment briefly
 *     looks overdue and gets swept. This is survivable only because the payment context ignores a cancellation of a
 *     payment that already settled. The pattern leans on rule two of this module rather harder than it first
 *     appears.</li>
 *     <li><b>Precision is the poll interval.</b> Fine for "give up after fifteen minutes", useless for "act at
 *     09:00:00 exactly".</li>
 *     <li><b>The query must stay a query.</b> Filtering at the database on an indexed column, never loading
 *     everything and filtering in memory.</li>
 * </ul>
 * The honest summary: this replaces a deadline manager with a deadline projection. Simple, replayable and needing no
 * new infrastructure, but approximate in time, and acceptable only because every command it sends can be sent
 * twice.

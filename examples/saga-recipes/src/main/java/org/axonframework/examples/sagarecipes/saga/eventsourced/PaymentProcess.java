/**
 * The rental payment process, event-sourced from events of its own.
 * <p>
 * A saga store serializes the process instance, so its state is a snapshot rather than a history. Nothing forces that
 * here: the process can be event-sourced like anything else, from facts it writes itself.
 * <p>
 * <b>Why bother, given the derived-state recipe exists.</b> That one rebuilds its answer from the two contexts'
 * events, which requires them to be in your store and to carry a tag you can select on. Against a payment provider
 * whose events are not yours, that is impossible. This process reads only its own events, so it needs nothing from
 * the other side beyond being told that something happened. It also leaves an audit trail of the process itself,
 * which neither of the other two recipes can produce.
 * <p>
 * <b>Why the extra command.</b> Recording goes through {@link RecordPaymentRequested} rather than being appended
 * here, so that every event still comes from a command and the process's own write stays visible on an event model
 * as a write slice. The price is a second dispatch per step, and {@link AppendingPaymentProcess} in this package is
 * the same recipe without it, sharing this one's events and its {@link ProcessState}.
 * <p>
 * <b>The ordering rule is unchanged.</b> Dispatch the real work first, record only once it succeeded. Only the medium
 * differs from the repository recipe: an event instead of a row.
 * <p>
 * <b>How it ends.</b> {@link RentalPaymentProcessCompleted} is appended, and every handler short-circuits on it
 * afterwards. This is what {@code @EndSaga} used to do, expressed as a fact rather than a callback.

/**
 * Asks for payment whenever a bike is requested.
 * <p>
 * Completely stateless, and worth pausing on. There is no check for whether payment was already asked for, because
 * there is nowhere to check and no need: the reference is derived from the rental, and the payment context refuses to
 * prepare a second payment under a reference it already knows. Idempotency lives where the decision lives.
 * <p>
 * That leaves the processor's record of progress as the entire to-do list, a tracking token on the streaming
 * processor this application configures. Everything before it has been asked for, everything after it has not, and
 * handling the same event twice is harmless.

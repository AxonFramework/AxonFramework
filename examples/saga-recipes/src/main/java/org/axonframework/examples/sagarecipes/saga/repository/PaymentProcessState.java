/**
 * What the process remembers about one rental.
 * <p>
 * The nearest thing in the module to a saga store entry, with one difference that matters: the schema is yours. A
 * saga store serializes the whole instance into an opaque blob, so the only way to ask a question of it is to
 * deserialize it. Here the columns are ordinary columns and can be queried, indexed and reported on.
 * <p>
 * The fields worth noticing are {@code bikeId} and {@code renter}. They are the reason this process needs storage at
 * all: no entity in either context is keyed by a rental, so nothing else can tell the process which bike to approve
 * once payment arrives.

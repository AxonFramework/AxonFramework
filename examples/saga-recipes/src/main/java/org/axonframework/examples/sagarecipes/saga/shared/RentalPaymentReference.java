/**
 * Translates between a rental and the payment reference that stands for it.
 * <p>
 * This is the only code in the application that knows these two are the same value. The rental context does not know
 * payments exist, and the payment context treats the reference as an opaque string. Holding that one piece of
 * knowledge, and nothing else, is what the saga is for.
 * <p>
 * Because the mapping is derived rather than stored, the saga needs no state to correlate in either direction:
 * outbound it computes the reference from the rental, inbound it reads the reference off the payment event. That is
 * worth noticing before reaching for a saga at all, since a common reason to keep state is purely
 * to remember an identifier they could have computed.
 * <p>
 * The alternative, a randomly generated reference, would force a stored mapping and rule out the recipes that keep
 * no state. Should a rental ever need a second payment attempt, the derivation would have to include the attempt
 * number rather than being abandoned.

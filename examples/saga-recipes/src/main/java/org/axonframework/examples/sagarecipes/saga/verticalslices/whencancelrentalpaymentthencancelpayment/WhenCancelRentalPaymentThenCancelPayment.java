/**
 * Passes a request to give up waiting on to the payment context.
 * <p>
 * The other recipes answer {@link CancelRentalPayment} by consulting their own state first, to avoid asking for
 * something pointless. This slice does not, and the omission is deliberate. Whether cancelling is still worthwhile is
 * a question about the payment, and the payment context answers it authoritatively; the process's own view can only
 * ever be a stale copy of that answer. Checking here would duplicate a decision that is not this slice's to make, and
 * would still need the payment context's check to be correct under a race.
 * <p>
 * So the whole slice is a translation: a rental-shaped request becomes a payment-shaped one. That is all a slice like
 * this ever is.

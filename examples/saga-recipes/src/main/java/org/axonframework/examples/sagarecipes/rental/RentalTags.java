/**
 * Tag keys used by the rental context.
 * <p>
 * Tags are what a Dynamic Consistency Boundary selects on. Every rental event carries all three, which lets each
 * slice pick the narrowest boundary its rule needs: {@link #BIKE_ID} for "is this bike available",
 * {@link #RENTER} for "does this renter already hold a bike", and {@link #RENTAL_ID} to correlate a single request
 * across its whole lifetime.
 * <p>
 * {@link #RENTER} costs nothing to add now and cannot be added retroactively to an existing event stream, which is
 * why it is present from the start even though only one slice currently uses it.

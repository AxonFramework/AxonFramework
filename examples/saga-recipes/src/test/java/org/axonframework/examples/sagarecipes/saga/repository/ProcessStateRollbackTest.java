/**
 * Proves the claim this recipe is built on: the row it writes and the tracking token commit together, so a step that
 * cannot finish leaves nothing behind.
 * <p>
 * Every command this process sends is idempotent by design, which means none of them can fail on their own. The
 * failure therefore has to be injected, and a {@link MessageDispatchInterceptor} is the least invasive place to do it:
 * it rejects the command before any of the payment context runs, so nothing but the saga's own unit of work is
 * involved in what the assertion observes.
 * <p>
 * Reading the outcome is unambiguous because the handler guards on the row it wrote. If the write survived the failed
 * step, the redelivered event finds {@code paymentRequested} already set, reports success, lets the token advance and
 * leaves the row in place forever -- a process wedged having never asked for payment. If the write rolled back, no row
 * ever appears no matter how many times the event is redelivered. So a present row means broken atomicity and an
 * absent row means the transaction did its job.

/**
 * The deadline replacement, on its own.
 * <p>
 * Two halves, tested separately because they fail for different reasons. The projection records what is outstanding,
 * and the property being pinned there is that rows come and go purely as a function of events, never as a side effect
 * of sweeping: that is what stops the list drifting from the event stream, and what lets the sweeper be a pure reader.
 * The sweep then notices what has waited too long.
 * <p>
 * How a recipe reacts to being asked to give up is not tested here. That is the process's behaviour, and it belongs in
 * the shared contract every recipe satisfies. A recipe is nevertheless active below, for the mundane reason that the
 * sweep dispatches a command and a command needs a handler.
 * <p>
 * The scheduled trigger itself is deliberately untested. It is one line delegating to a method that takes the moment
 * to judge against as an argument, and testing it would mean testing Spring.

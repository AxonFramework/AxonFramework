/**
 * Runs the shared contract against the recipe with no process class at all.
 * <p>
 * This is the most interesting run of the matrix. The same six scenarios pass, but nothing here is called
 * {@code PaymentProcess}: the behaviour emerges from six independent slices, none of which knows the others exist. It is
 * the strongest evidence the module offers that "saga" names a shape of behaviour rather than a thing that has to be
 * built.
 * <p>
 * Nothing is added below, because there is nothing recipe-specific to assert. Two of the slices keep no state and the
 * rest keep only a read-through lookup, so the observable contract is the whole story.

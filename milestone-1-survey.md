# Axon Framework 5 M1 Survey

We, the Axon Framework team, are very happy to announce the first milestone of Axon Framework 5.
While not a complete release, we are excited to share the progress we've made so far.

The biggest motivator for a Milestone release is to gather feedback from the community.
So we encourage you to try it out and share your thoughts with us.

## Scope

This milestone release is focused on the following areas:

- *Asynchronous core*: The core of Axon Framework has been completely rewritten to be asynchronous by default.
- *Configuration*: The configuration of Axon Framework has been simplified and made more flexible. Support for
  decorators has been added, and you can create encapsulated modules with their own partial configuration.
- *Dynamic Consistency Boundary*: We are breaking free from the aggregate concept. Entities now allow a flexible
  boundaries, making it possible to combine events from different tags. This greatly reduces the need to use sagas, and
  makes code flexible for whatever requirements pop up in the future.

We plan to release at least two more milestones releases before the final release of Axon Framework 5. This milestone
release does not contain, for example:

- Spring Boot support
- Redesigned event processors
- TODO: Base on roadmap?

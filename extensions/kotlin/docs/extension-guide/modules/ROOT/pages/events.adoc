This section describes the additional functionality attached to Axon's xref:axon_framework_old_ref:events:README.adoc[event publication and handling] logic.

== Event upcasters

A simplified implementation of the xref:axon_framework_old_ref:events:event-versioning.adoc#event-upcasting[Single Event Upcaster] is given, which allows for a shorter implementation cycle. Making an upcaster to upcast the `CardIssuedEvent` from revision `0` to `1` can be written as follows:

[source,kotlin]
----
import com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.JsonNode
import org.axonframework.serialization.upcasting.event.SingleEventUpcaster

fun `CardIssuedEvent 0 to 1 Upcaster`(): SingleEventUpcaster =
        EventUpcaster.singleEventUpcaster(
                eventType = CardIssuedEvent::class,
                storageType = JsonNode::class,
                revisions = Revisions("0", "1")
        ) { event ->
            // Perform your upcasting process of the CardIssuedEvent here
            event
        }

class CardIssuedEvent
----

Alternatively, since `Revisions` is essentially a `Pair` of `String`, it is also possible to use link:https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin/to.html[Kotlin's `to` function,window=_blank,role=external]:

[source,kotlin]
----
EventUpcaster.singleEventUpcaster(
        eventType = CardIssuedEvent::class,
        storageType = JsonNode::class,
        revisions = "0" to "1"
) { event ->
    // Perform your upcasting process of the CardIssuedEvent here
    event
}

/**
 * Factory for building {@link EventProcessorModule EventProcessorModules} from a set of discovered event handler components.
 * <p>
 * This interface should only be implemented if the default assignment rules for event processors need to be
 * customized beyond what {@link EventProcessorDefinition} provides. The factory is responsible for determining which event
 * handlers should be assigned to which processors and creating the corresponding modules.
 * <p>
 * The default implementation ({@link DefaultProcessorModuleFactory}) uses {@link EventProcessorDefinition ProcessorDefinitions}
 * to assign handlers based on their selectors. If no matching processor definition is found for a handler, it defaults to
 * assigning the handler to a processor named after the handler's package.
 * <p>
 * Custom implementations can provide completely different assignment logic, such as:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>Assigning handlers based on annotations</li>
 *     <li>Using naming conventions</li>
 *     <li>Grouping by domain boundaries</li>
 *     <li>Implementing custom load balancing strategies</li>
 * </ul>

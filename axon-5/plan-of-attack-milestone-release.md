# Plan of Attack for Milestone Release

This document serves the purpose of drafting a plan of attack towards a milestone of Axon Framework 5.

## Goal

Release a milestone of Axon Framework 5 at or before the AxonIQ Conference of 2023 in September.

## Plan

1. Restart design principle sessions, holding several _before_ starting development. 
   Intended to iron out the remaining major points we can think of.
2. Start development once we've held sufficient (whatever sufficient may be) design sessions.
   Desire is that development starts half April!
3. DO NOT start development alone, especially when working on APIs! 
   Ensure pairing is in place when important parts are build. 
   This allows quick discussions on the way forward without wasting effort.
4. To maintain speed, frequent weekly sessions are required.
   For example, twice or thrice a week, in sessions between one or two hours.
   The way we're picking up the Inspector Axon project as a fair example.
5. Schedule reoccurring session to work on Axon Framework 5, according to point four.
6. A mixed attendance makes sense, although a main contributor, should be present as frequent as possible.
7. If a pairing session proofs insufficient to deduce a thorough API, hold a new design principles session.
8. Once a new API is in place, discuss it with the design principles team.
   Do so to make certain we stick to the design principles.
9. Once some approaches become common practice within Axon Framework 5, solo programming should become an option.
   Done to ensure speed is maintained to reach the goal.
   You can think of boilerplate code, POJO construction, JavaDoc, or providing a second/third/... implementation of a discussed interface.

Version and Dependency Compatibility
====================================

* Axon Framework is no longer based on JDK 8, but on JDK 21 instead.
* Spring Boot 2 is no longer supported. You should upgrade to Spring Boot 3 or higher.
* Spring Framework 5 is no longer supported. You should upgrade to Spring Framework 6 or higher.
* Javax Persistence is completely replaced for Jakarta Persistence. This means the majority of `javax` reference no
  longer apply.

Major API Changes
=================

* **All** code marked as `@Deprecated` in Axon Framework 4 is removed entirely. Each deprecation contains the
  recommended resolution path in the JavaDoc. It is strongly recommended to (1) upgrade to the latest Axon Framework 4
  version, (2) adjust any deprecations from Axon Framework you are using as recommended, and then (3) to make the change
  towards Axon Framework 5.
* The entire API of the `UnitOfWork` has been rewritten to (1) construct an 'async-native' flow to support both an
  imperative and reactive style of programming, (2) eliminate the use of `ThreadLocal`, and (3) protect users from
  internals APIs. This does mean that any direct interaction with the `UnitOfWork` has become a breaking change. Please
  check the [Unit of Work](#unit-of-work) section for more details if you are facing this predicament.
* All message-based infrastructure in Axon Framework will return the `MessageStream` interface. The `MessageStream` is
  intended to support empty results, results of one entry, and results of N entries, thus mirroring Event Handlers (no
  results), Command Handlers (one result), and Query Handlers (N results). Added, the `MessageStream` will function as a
  replacement for components like the `DomainEventStream` and `BlockingStream` on the `EventStore`. As such, the
  `MessageStream` changes **a lot** of (public) APIs within Axon Framework. Please check
  the [Message Stream](#message-stream) section for more details, like an exhaustive list of all the adjusted
  interfaces.
* We no longer support message handler annotated constructors. For example, the constructor of an aggregate can no
  longer contain the `@CommandHandler` annotation. Instead, the `@CreationPolicy` should be used.

## Unit of Work

The `UnitOfWork` interface has been rewritten with roughly three goals in mind:

1. Ensure the API of the `UnitOfWork` easily supports imperative and reactive programming styles.
2. Remove the use of the `ThreadLocal` entirely. This change is paramount for a reactive programming style.
3. Guard users from operations they shouldn't touch. The biggest example of this, was the previous `UnitOfWork#commit`
   operation that **was not** intended to be used by users.

To that end, we broke down the `UnitOfWork` interface into two interfaces and a concrete implementation, being:

1. The `ProcessingLifecycle`, describing methods to register actions into distinct `ProcessingLifeCycle.Phases`, thus
   managing the "lifecycle of a process."
2. The `ProcessingContext`, an implementation of the `ProcessingLifecycle` adding resource management.
3. The `UnitOfWork`, an implementation of the `ProcessingContext` and thus `ProcessingLifecycle`.

The user is intended to interface with the `ProcessingLifecycle` when they need to add actions before/after/during
pre-defined `ProcessingLifecycle.DefaultPhases`.
This will allow us, and them, to customize processes like message handling.
Furthermore, the `ProcessingLifecycle` works with a `CompletableFuture` throughout.

The `ProcessingContext` will in turn provide the space to register resources to be used throughout the
`ProcessingLifecycle`.
Although roughly similar to the previous resource management of the old `UnitOfWork`, we intend this format to replace
the use of the `ThreadLocal`.
As such, you will notice that the `ProcessingContext` will become a parameter throughout virtually all infrastructure
interfaces Axon Framework provides.

It is the replacement of the interfaces with the old `UnitOfWork`, and the spreading of the `ProcessingContext`
instead of the `UnitOfWork` directly, will ensure that operation that are not intended for the end user cannot be
accessed easily anymore.

To conclude, here is a list of changes to take into account concerning the `UnitOfWork`:

1. Operations like `start()`, `commit()`, and `rollback()` are no longer available for the user directly.
2. The nesting functionality of the old `UnitOfWork` through operations like `parent()` and `root()` are completely
   removed.
3. The `UnitOfWork` used to revolve around a `Message`, which is no longer the case for the `ProcessingContext`/
   `ProcessingLifeycle`. Instead, the new approach revolves around a generic action, that may or may not return a
   result.
4. You are no longer tied to the predefined not-started, started, prepare-commit, commit, after-commit, rollback,
   clean-up, and closed phases. Instead, the default phases now are pre-invocation, invocation, post-invocation,
   prepare-commit, commit, and after-commit.
5. The default phases are ordered through the use of an `int`, with space between them to add action before, after, or
   during any phase.
6. The `rollback` logic has been replaced by an on-error, on-complete, and on-finally flow.
   `ProcessingLifecycle#onError` registers an action to be taken on error, while `whenComplete` registers an action to
   performed when after worked as intended. `ProcessingLifecycle#doFinally` registers an operation that is performed on
   success **and** failure of the `ProcessingLifecycle`.
7. Correlation data management, and thus construction of the initial `MetaData` of any `Message`, is removed entirely.
   This is inline with the `UnitOfWork` no longer revolving around a `Message`.
8. The "current" `UnitOfWork` (including the `CurrentUnitOfWork`) is no longer a concept. Instead, all infrastructure
   components will pass along the current context by containing the `ProcessingContext` as a parameter throughout.

Note that the rewrite of the `UnitOfWork` has caused _a lot_ of API changes and numerous removals. For an exhaustive
list of the latter, please check [here](#removed).

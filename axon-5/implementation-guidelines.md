# Implementation Guidelines

When constructing Axon Framework 5, and you are in doubt, take the following guidelines into account:

1. Ease of use when using the Framework.
2. Support both reactive and non-reactive application design.
3. Support both annotation-less and annotation based application design.
4. Composition over inheritance.
5. Contribution by outsiders should be feasible, so discuss with people outside the development team.

/**
 * Interface describing the operations available on a test phase for testing Axon-based applications using a
 * given-when-then pattern. The test phase provides a fluent API to configure and execute tests against Axon
 * components.
 *
 * <p>
 * This interface defines four primary phases of a test:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link Setup} - Initial configuration of the test fixture</li>
 *   <li>{@link Given} - Defining the initial state of the system before testing by events and commands</li>
 *   <li>{@link When} - Executing commands to test</li>
 *   <li>{@link Then} - Validating the results of the test</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * The test fixture manages {@link UnitOfWork} instances during test execution,
 * automatically committing as appropriate. During the Given phase, each operation (like {@link Given#event}},
 * {@link Given#command} or even batched like {@link Given#events} and {@link Given#commands})
 * is executed in its own separate {@link UnitOfWork} that is committed immediately after execution. In the When phase, a single Unit of Work is started
 * and committed after the command is executed. The Then phase only validates the results.
 * <p>
 * The test phases operates on components defined in {@link Configuration} that you pass to the fixture during its construction.
 * <p>
 * Typical usage example:<br/>
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 * var fixture = AxonTestFixture.with(configurer);
 *
 * fixture.given()
 *        .event(new AccountCreatedEvent("account-1"))
 *        .when()
 *        .command(new WithdrawMoneyCommand("account-1", 100.00))
 *        .then()
 *        .success()
 *        .events(new MoneyWithdrawnEvent("account-1", 100.00));
 * }
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * Example with chaining multiple test scenarios using {@code and()}:<br/>
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 * var fixture = AxonTestFixture.with(configurer);
 *
 * fixture.given()
 *        .event(new AccountCreatedEvent("account-1", 500.00))
 *        .when()
 *        .command(new WithdrawMoneyCommand("account-1", 100.00))
 *        .then()
 *        .events(new MoneyWithdrawnEvent("account-1", 100.00))
 *        .success()
 *        .and()
 *        .when()
 *        .command(new WithdrawMoneyCommand("account-1", 500.00))
 *        .then()
 *        .exception(InsufficientBalanceException.class)
 *        .noEvents();
 * }
 * </pre>

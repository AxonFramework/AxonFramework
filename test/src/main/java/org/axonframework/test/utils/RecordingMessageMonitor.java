/**
 * A message monitor implementation that records the processing results of messages in the provided
 * {@link MessageMonitorReport} instances. It supports logging the processing outcomes if logging is enabled. This
 * monitor tracks whether messages were successfully processed, failed, or ignored and stores this information in the
 * provided reports.
 * <p>
 * The class provides two constructors: one allows configuring a single report instance while enabling logging, and the
 * other accepts a list of reports, defaulting logging to disabled.
 * <p>
 * The monitor provides functionality to handle messages as they are ingested and uses a callback to record the
 * processing result for each message.
 * <p/>
 * For further inspection, for example logging, you can overwrite the {@link #onReportSuccess(Message)}, {@link #onReportFailure(Message, Throwable)}
 * and {@link #onReportIgnored(Message)} methods.

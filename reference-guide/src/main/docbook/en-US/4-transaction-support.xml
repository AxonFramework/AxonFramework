    <title>Transaction Support</title>
    <sect1>
        <title>Adding transaction support</title>

        <para>Events are handled in small batches. The size of these batches can be configured on a per-
            EventListener basis. The event listener can receive notification of a start or end of such a transaction
            and configure it as desired.
        </para>
        <para>If a transaction manager implements the
            <code>TransactionAware</code>
            interface, the beforeTransaction and
            afterTransaction methods are called prior and after a event handling batch, respectively. The implementation
            of these method can start transactions to external systems, such as a DBMS.
        </para>
        <para>
            Alternatively, you can annotate methods with the
            <code>@BeforeTransaction</code>
            and
            <code>@AfterTransaction</code>
            annotations. These methods may have 1 parameter of type<code>TransactionStatus</code>.
            This parameter provides access to the current transaction status and provides options to configure the
            transaction.
